https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-tips,top 10 cybersecurity awareness tips how to stay safe and proactive,cybersecurity is gaining more importance globally as technology continues to advance. the emphasis on security stems from the need for organizations to be prepared for when not if a data breach occurs. unfortunately human error is often the cause of breaches. understanding how to combat cyberattacks is crucial as protecting sensitive information is everyones responsibility in our datadriven world. in honor of cybersecurity awareness month  weve compiled the top security tips you can implement to be more secure. by incorporating these tactics you decrease the likelihood of your information or actions causing a catastrophic breach. multifactor authentication adds an extra layer of security by verifying a users identity through methods like receiving a verification code or clicking a link when logging in. enabling mfa is crucial because the absence of it increases your vulnerability to risks. attackers dont break in they log in said joseph avanzato a forensics expert at varonis during a live session on understanding a threat actors mindset. enable mfa for services that offer it and use an authenticator app if available. report any unusual login attempts immediately. for organizations its best to require mfa and restrict the option to disable it. its tempting to create a link accessible to anyone rather than just specific users in the event that additional stakeholders need access. however microsoft reports that only 1 of orgwide permissions granted are actually used. a vast amount of business documents contain sensitive information that shouldnt be accessible to everyone in the org let alone anyone on the internet. removing the ability to create orgwide links can significantly reduce your orgs blast radius. in the average company 157000 sensitive records are exposed to everyone on the internet through saas sharing features representing 28 million in databreach risk. rather than opting for an overpermissioned link users should share files directly with those who need access to do their job and invite others to access on a casebycase basis. social engineering and phishing tactics are still some of the most effective ways hackers gain access. common signs of phishing include a peculiar sender address a sense of urgency in the request and prompting users to click a link. phishing simulations are an effective way for organizations to educate teams on the impact of engaging with suspicious communications and encourage users to proactively look for scams. as a consumer or employee its important to vet any unknown senders who contact you via text email and more. all it takes is one click to give threat actors keys to the data kingdom. to expand on tip number three its not enough to shrug off a suspicious text message and call it a day. most phishing attempts target more than one user in an organization so if you receive one report it to your it department. some companies have plugins within their email service or a dedicated inbox to forward suspicious activity to. even a simple response to phishing attempts can backfire so avoid engaging in any type of conversation. additionally never share information or make purchases without verifying the contacts identity. administrative access in cloud platforms like salesforce is powerful. at many organizations existing admins can grant access to others in these tools without it oversight. this results in too many users having escalated privileges and access to sensitive information. in varonis dspm snapshot report  we found that 60 of an average companys administrative accounts do not enable mfa making it easier for attackers to compromise internally exposed data. many orgs are unaware of the shared responsibility model  which holds saas providers accountable for securing a platforms infrastructure and providing a highly available solution while consumers are responsible for protecting and securing their data within. when someone in your organization requests admin access to an application you manage assess if the request is justified and consider setting an expiration for the permissions to maintain security. coordinate with your it and security teams to ensure all administrators understand the shared responsibility model and adhere to the established permission protocols. imagine signing up for the latest social networking app and to bypass filling out a lengthy form you can simply connect it to your gmail account thus opening up access to your information stored within this app. but while setting this connection up is easy its challenging to understand how the apps are configured and what access they have to information stored in your connected service. there is also the risk that apps contain vulnerabilities that threat actors could exploit. through a single click access can be granted to these malicious applications. the varonis threat labs team created an attack scenario in which we created a realisticlooking app and used a phishing technique to convince a user to install an app and grant full access to their microsoft 365 environment. while our scenario was a simulation most hackers and ransomware groups wouldnt stop at gaining access and would further exploit the information they find. as the use of thirdparty apps rises its essential to assess your connected apps and the risks involved with them. we recommend analyzing the permissions for each app and ranking their risk level as low medium or high. with varonis organizations can see how many employees use a thirdparty app and view their activity levels via automation or manual reporting. to avoid breaches users who havent opened a highrisk app in the last six months should have their permissions revoked. you may want to consider disconnecting the app altogether if its not being used. as technology has evolved the public expects access to wifi nearly everywhere they go said matt radolec varonis vice president of incident response and cloud operations in an interview with cnbc . he added that users arent reading the terms and conditions or checking urls when connecting to free wifi options increasing their chances of compromise. its almost a game to see how fast you can click accept and then sign in or connect. this is the ploy especially when visiting a new location a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site matt said. be cautious of free wifi networks you connect your device to and make your computer forget them from your stored networks once you have finished your session. large language models llms like chatgpt can use your data to train their systems. if you share sensitive information during a chat your data might unknowingly appear in another session or even worse in a hackers hands. tools like microsoft 365 copilot are also designed to access everything the user can which is often far too much. ensure your organization is ready to deploy ai tools safely before during and after rollout. data privacy is a major concern regarding ai. organizations recognize the need to safeguard privacy while maintaining ai functionality which can be challenging. we want to leverage llm technology varonis security architect brock bauer said during a webinar on llm risks in the cloud . we want to give the productivity capabilities to our users but we also need to protect the privacy of the data theyre accessing. when using ai always keep your sensitive details out of chats. security teams should set up ai policies in their orgs and ensure employees are trained to properly use approved gen ai solutions. it can be pesky to see an automatic restart window pop up right in the middle of an important task but the longer you wait to update your computer the more misconfigurations remain unpatched. patches are solutions to vulnerabilities discovered in different software and cloud platforms. in 2021 our research team identified a bug in salesforce dubbed einsteins wormhole . this bug exposed calendar events that could contain highly sensitive data such as attendee names emails meeting urls passwords and replies being sent to organizers. before the bug was patched meeting information with potentially sensitive information was exposed to the entire internet. being proactive with your device and software updates decreases the likelihood of being compromised due to a misconfiguration. password managers let users create complex passwords for all their signins preventing threat actors from accessing their accounts. whether you use a password manager or not it is important to create different passwords for different sites opt for additional security measures like mfa and set up alerts when logins occur from unknown devices or locations. these small best practices for password generation can be key to preventing data compromise in a breach. with breaches on the rise its crucial to prioritize cybersecurity. following these preventative cybersecurity tips can help you have stronger security practices at work and at home. for organizations pairing effective training with toptier security technology creates an ideal cybersecurity solution. want to learn more get started with a free data risk assessment to

https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/11-cyber-defense-tips-to-stay-secure-at-work-and-home,11 cyber defense tips to stay secure at work and home,cybersecurity is inextricably tied to the technology it protects. just as technology continues to grow in variety quantity and presence in all of our lives so too does cybersecurity and our personal responsibility for it. you might be wondering how you can best act on this responsibility. the answer strengthen your cyber defense at home and at work. provided below are 11 steps that you can use to get started. what are your cyber defense goals have you identified which devices and data you want to protect what level of security do they need by considering these and similar types of questions you can start to formulate a cybersecurity roadmap that makes sense for you. hover over a link to reveal the destination url. if it looks different from the hyperlinked text dont click on it. it could be an attempt to trick you into visiting a phishing landing page. to protect yourself against phishing attacks search instead for your intended website or enter the url directly into your browsers navigation bar. speaking of phishing if you receive a suspicious email at work dont open or click on it. instead follow up with your it andor security department. how can you tell a suspicious email from a legitimate one the former will often use a sense of urgency including a sale an emergency or a negative consequence such as an account closure to motivate you to click on a link or open an email attachment. dont fall for it. if you come across this type of email just stop breathe and forward it to your it andor your security department. if you receive this type of email on your personal device delete the email and consider blocking the domain. cyber threat actors ctas can easily crack passwords like password admin or 123456. the same goes for dictionarybased passwords or combinations made up of words that you can find in a dictionary. instead of a simple password try using a passphrase that sometimes substitutes numbers and symbols for letters. this unique approach can help you remember long strings for added security. as an example consider the weak password cheese compared to the complex passphrases 1l0v3h33s3 modified from ilovecheese or m0r3h33s3pl3s3 modified from morecheeseplease. to properly secure your devices and data protect your laptop smartphone and any other device you use with a secure passphrase such as the examples above. you can also consider using biometric passcodes if your device supports this option or you can use a pin or matric passcode for authentication. if you end up creating an alphanumeric passphrase with symbols make sure you use unique combinations for each of your accounts. remember that you can also generate passphrases using a password manager. the benefit there is that you can have the password manager remember each of your passwords so you dont have to. all you need to do is to protect access to your password manager with a strong passphrase and with multifactor authentication mfa. to implement multifactor authentication mfa you need to protect your account with authentication mechanisms from at least two of the following categories. use a minimum of twofactor authentication 2fa on any important accounts or computers where sensitive data is handled. that way even if a cta gains access to your username and password they wont be able to access your account without the other factors. always install the latest updates for your operating system browser and any applications installed on your device. ctas try to use known vulnerabilities to access your devices andor other devices that are connected to the same network. dont let yourself or your organization become an easy target. before you connect to an unfamiliar andor public wifi network think about the risks of doing so. what data might you share over the connection to minimize the risk of data exposure use a virtual private network vpn. a vpn acts as a secure tunnel over the internet by creating an encrypted private web connection. with a vpn you can rest assured that your personal or workrelated data is secure. shopping online is a modern everyday convenience. protect sensitive banking data by only shopping on sites you trust. never save your card information where it could be stolen and used later. also make sure to monitor your payment card records for unfamiliar charges. if you come across anything suspicious reach out to the payment card issuer to dispute the charge and request a new payment card. configuration sounds like a big responsibility  and its an important part of your security program. but it really comes down to the settings for a particular program or machine. securely configure your computer printer smartphone and other webconnected devices in your home and your office. when online remember to be thoughtful and to use polite language. sharing someones private personal information online also known as doxxing is never okay and may get you in legal trouble. dont plug your mobile devices into any outlet you find. whether its a work or personal device you could risk becoming the victim of juicejacking a type of attack where ctas compromise public usb charging stations to infect unsuspecting users with malware or data theft. if youre worried about running out of battery bring a backup power bank or charge your device using your own charging cable and a wall outlet. want even more tips to stay safe at home and at work as of june 23

https://nordlayer.com/learn/network-security/basics/,network security 101 understanding the basics,every week networks seem to grow in size and complexity. new saas services come online while innovative communication tools make remote working easier. data storage methods shift with new assets to secure. and new malware threats constantly emerge. in an everchanging digital world network security has never been more crucial. network security is not a fixed constant. methods to protect networks change all the time. in this glossary article we will explain network security basics. we will introduce the cia concept and we will also look at contemporary security techniques. this article overviews the topic but you can finetune your knowledge with detailed texts about related concepts. networks are collections of devices and applications. when linked together these assets serve core business functions. network managers can place devices on different network segments while they may also be geographically distant. but they are all part of the same workstations servers switches and saas gateways community . networks come in a variety of types. security measures required vary depending on network configurations. common variants include networks operate at level 3 of the osi model . the network layer is where data is transmitted. servers create packets of information which they send to network devices via routing devices. packets are then rendered readable at the other end. numerical ip addresses usually identify network devices. but more advanced network architecture uses text labels for the same purpose. systems may also apply encryption to data passing over the network. encryption conceals the contents of packets protecting them against external observers. network devices are any items of hardware connected to the network architecture. every network should be documented and mapped. mapping enables managers to understand which devices require protection. company networks generally rely on several device types monitoring tools track traffic and user behavior inside the network perimeter. it also checks the status of network devices such as servers or switches and informs network managers when faults occur. monitoring can be reactive or proactive. proactive monitoring is preferable anticipating problems and seeking threats before they cause damage. monitoring can also be agentbased or agentless this form of monitoring installs software agents on every network client . agents connect to centralized monitoring software. they provide a stream of data about the status of the device. this data could include memory usage and processes running on the device. agents may track user connections or assess general performance. agentbased monitoring delivers granular information and enhances network visibility . however the proliferation of agents poses problems. security teams must set aside time to update and log agents. managing large communities of agents can be difficult for smaller organizations. this type of monitoring focuses on data passing across external and internal network connections . it involves packet inspection to discover information about data and network usage. and it can also involve app monitoring to ensure only authenticated users have access. agentless monitoring is nonintrusive and requires few resources. it provides a data stream that can be used to improve security setups. but this information is generally not granular. network managers may lack complete awareness of threats. monitoring is not always constant. instead security managers schedule inspections of digital assets to assess functionality and security status. the gap between security inspections is the monitoring interval. intervals vary depending on device type and situation. technicians schedule constant inspections of the internal network. however general network performance measurements may have longer monitoring intervals. this reduces the load placed on the network. network security is the process of protecting networks against potential threats . it includes software and hardware designed to detect and block malicious agents. securing networks also extends to access control network organization and security policies. networking security is closely related to cybersecurity and information security . cybersecurity guards against digital threats. infosec focuses on data protection. both feed into protecting a single computer connected to the network infrastructure against outside threats. network security matters because data and apps need protection . businesses depend on reliable access to workloads and databases. however they must secure confidential data from external observers via information security techniques. a wellthoughtout security strategy balances access and protection while also meeting compliance goals. there are several networking security policy ingredients. common approaches include levels of control make securing networks easier to understand. there are three control levels. companies should factor them all into their security strategies secure physical devices with multiple credentials for access manage user behavior through identity and access management systems locks and access controls protect servers and data storage devices protect data on network devices including servers and workstations enhance security with cameras and biometric scanners cover both locally connected and remote working devices onboard new employees and remove obsolete accounts to prevent credential theft ensure security without compromising network performance provide staff training to address security challenges the cia model is the most popular way of visualizing security methods for modern networks. this model is the basis for defenseindepth which means defending connected assets across all network layers. cia refers to the initials of the models core principles. these ideas include network managers must enforce all three cia principles across the entire network. in practice this means using several of the networking security approaches mentioned above. for example traffic monitoring identifies which users access specific apps at a given moment. but it also means employing the right tools to achieve the cia triad model. the exact mixture of tools varies but popular security options include a load balancer uses algorithms to determine traffic flows across the network. traffic balancing helps to avoid bottlenecks but also has cybersecurity benefits. for example load balancers can divert traffic when a service attack or ddos  occurs. a sandbox operates alongside ips tools to block aggressive malware actively. sandboxes create emulated environments. these environments assess network traffic and can identify attack techniques like port scanning that other scanners often miss. network traffic analysis tools use ai to analyze network traffic. they compare realtime traffic to secure baselines. baseline comparison allows traffic analysis tools to detect anomalies and report attacks before they cause harm. robust networking security is the key to preventing data breaches and ransomware attacks. follow the cia model to create a comprehensive security strategy. take into account physical administrative and technical controls. and choose agent or agentless monitoring to ensure total awareness.,1054
https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-network-security,what is network security definition and types  fortinet,discover the types of network security and how it can help secure your networks. network security refers to the technologies policies people and procedures that defend any communication infrastructure from cyberattacks unauthorized access and data loss while upholding the principles of the cia triad .in addition to the network itself they also secure traffic and networkaccessible assets at both the network edge and inside the perimeter. digital acceleration paved the way for business efficiencies cost reductions and productivity improvements. yet it has also led to an expanded attack surface across the growing network edge. from local area networks lan and wide area networks wan to the internet of things iot and cloud computing each new deployment results in another potential vulnerability. worse yet increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals are exploiting network vulnerabilities at an alarming rate. malware  ransomware distributed denialofservice ddos attacks and countless other threats are challenging it teams to fortify their defenses. in turn enterprises have much to gain by strengthening their network protections hardware plays a vital role in securing the infrastructure. three devices in particular are relevant to network security network security solutions to stay ahead of cyberthreats discover key network security components to achieve secure digital acceleration. a firewall is a device that monitors filters and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. acting as a barrier between trusted internal and untrusted external networks it works by inspecting data packets and choosing to block or allow them. for example a financial institution might configure its firewall to block traffic coming from unauthorized ip addresses while still allowing legitimate traffic to pass through. this mitigates a potential breach without interrupting core operations. nextgeneration firewall ngfw is a modern iteration that goes beyond traditional solutions incorporating deeper packet inspection for more robust protection. ngfws often package many essential network security capabilities into one comprehensive offering including intrusion prevention antivirus and file sandboxing web and dns filtering and more. with a hybrid mesh architecture  firewalls next evolution  organizations can centralize control and visibility of formerly disparate tools. this makes it easier to coordinate and control policies across onpremise and cloudbased firewalls not to mention multiple branches and campus locations. intrusion prevention systems detect and block known and suspected threats before they can impact the network core or devices at its edge. in addition to northsouth and eastwest deep packet inspection including inspection of encrypted traffic they can also provide virtual patching which mitigates vulnerabilities at the network level. using an ips organizations can rapidly detect attack signatures and abnormal behavior. the system automatically takes action to block malicious traffic while alerting administrators for further investigation. antivirus and sandboxing tools are key to determining whether a file is malicious. while antivirus blocks known malware threats sandboxing provides a safe environment to analyze suspicious files. lets say a user downloads a file from an email attachment. the antivirus software scans it for known attack signatures and behaviors. if its a confirmed threat the software quarantines or removes the file. for an unknown file sandboxing isolates it into a protected space where it can be tested to determine if its malicious. some security vendors are leveraging these capabilities in concert with ai allowing them to perform subsecond analysis of neverbeforeseen threats. domain name system dns filtering allows organizations to stop domainbased attacks such as dns hijacking tunneling etc. likewise url filtering prevents users and applications from accessing suspicious urls which could be linked to malicious websites. these web security tools help enterprises enforce acceptableuse policies while protecting them from harmful content. for instance if a user attempts to access a malicious website the web filter checks its database of categorized sites. if the domain has been flagged itll block access entirely. some firewall solutions now include cyber asset attack surface management tools that can help organizations automatically identify network it ot and iot assets and assess those assets for potential risks. the tools can also assess existing security infrastructure and controls for misconfigurations and lessthanoptimal settings that can then be updated to strengthen an organizations security posture. remote access vpns allow users to securely access the corporate network from outside their organizations office. they create a private encrypted connection from a public wifi network enabling employees to safely use critical resources from their personal devices regardless of location. these solutions are especially useful in hybrid work environments allowing remote workers to stay productive with the assurance their data is safe from malicious interception. network access control governs access to the network ensuring that only authorized and compliant devices gain entry. nac solutions identify and authenticate devices granting access only if they meet predefined compliance policies. for example enterprises might configure their nac to block certain device types. this prevents users from accessing the network on unprotected personal devices but it also can help the company manage iot and operational technology ot deployments. hardware that fails to meet the criteria may be quarantined redirected to a remediation network or denied entirely. although not directly supporting the network there are related cybersecurity technologies that help protect the infrastructure application programming interfaces apis allow openarchitecture casbs to directly integrate with saas providers. this enables admins to scan cloud configurations ensuring their users are monitored and protected no matter what device theyre using. here are the five key benefits of network security. network security protects sensitive data such as personal data intellectual property customer details financial records and more from cyber threats like malware ransomware and phishing. robust network security minimizes downtime and ensures the business remains operational and resilient against cyberattacks. effective network security ensures that organizations remain compliant with regulatory frameworks like the general data protection regulation gdpr and the payment card industry data security standard pci dss. this reduces the risk of legal fines and penalties. network security strengthens access control and authentication ensuring only authorized employees can access sensitive data and minimizing the risk of insider threats. commitment to protecting sensitive organizational and client data can enhance a businesss reputation and build trust with partners. the rise in new technology and platforms has expanded the attack surface providing hackers with multiple points to access an organizations network. in the context of cyber warfare  these expanded vulnerabilities can be exploited by nationstate actors to target critical infrastructure and disrupt essential services. while bringyourowndevice byod policies and remote work have blurred traditional location and network boundaries they have also introduced new vulnerabilities. for instance employees devices may lack robust network security controls which can expose data over unsecured networks. the complexity of modern networks especially with the growing use of cloud environments and human errors can result in misconfigurations leading to security gaps and cyber attacks. uncontrolled admin access can increase the risk of insider threats and data breaches. therefore organizations must monitor user activity and manage privileged access to prevent misuse. network security in inherently more complex in larger more complicated it environments. fortunately there are several solutions fit for network protection at scale modern security operations centers soc require a centralized approach to event management. without it they lack the context or visibility to protect the organization effectively. siem solutions provide a unified view of security across the enterprise collecting information from network endpoint cloud and other security products. they also offer behaviorbased aipowered threat detection investigation compliance reporting and more. in short siem reduces the complexity of managing network and security operations. ndr monitors internal network traffic baselining normal behaviors and using machine learning ml and other analytics to detect malware malicious traffic and abnormal patterns that may indicate an attacker within the network. it also provides a robust capability to investigate and take immediate action on verified alerts. xdr streamlines threat detection and response across an enterprises security ecosystem. by consolidating data from endpoints networks emails and the cloud it identifies and links suspicious activities that individual tools might miss. this integrated approach enables quick investigation and remediation of alerts or multistep incidents through automated and manual actions. leveraging endpoint detection and response edr capabilities xdr provides endpoint agents telemetry and endpoint blocking to effectively manage challenges while enhancing threat detection and response capabilities. the progression from endpoint detection and response  edr  to managed detection and response mdr to extended detection and response xdr follows the path of digital acceleration with everexpanding attack surfaces and a hybrid workforce. essentially the difference between edr mdr and xdr are as follows today network edges are anywhere the user connects and businesses may not be able to extend security everywhere its needed. managed security service providers mssps can help fill the gap with the critical expertise and infrastructure required immediately at less cost. for example a managed detection and response mdr service can be a great choice for smbs that need enterprisegrade threat monitoring and response but find it too expensive to build or staff internally. larger organizations who need more comprehensive protection of a distributed environment and dont have the resources in house can choose an xdr service for crosslayered detection and response. xdr collects normalizes and then correlates data over a variety of security layers including endpoints firewalls email servers cloud workloads and the general network. mdr is a fully managed threat detection and response service delivered by an outsourced mssp. with mdr services security teams can enhance their ability to rapidly detect investigate and respond to unauthorized andor suspicious activity. some mdr services also offer threat hunting and recommendations for improving overall security posture. some mssps also extend mdr with xdr which monitors detects and analyzes security signals across endpoints network cloud siem and email security systems. xdr is a new alternative approach to traditional detection and incident response  integrating detection and response procedures across multiple environments to reduce the mean time to detect and repair attacks. xdr is a natural extension of edr suitable for organizations that have complex it environments or are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. xdr is highly scalable supports multiple data sources and ensures endtoend protection of an organizations attack surfaces. a typical inhouse security operations center soc requires a dedicated staff of security engineers and analysts and the tools to support their work. the high cost of running a soc in house compounded by the shortage of cybersecurity talent and the burnout that often transpires leads many organizations to choose a managed socasaservice socaas. this allows them to outsource threat hunting monitoring detection and remediation to an mdr or mxdr service provider with the cybersecurity experience infrastructure and tools to actively monitor customers threat surfaces 247. cloud security is a shared responsibility. in general the public cloud infrastructure is secured by the service providersuch as aws azure or gcpand the workloads running on the infrastructure are secured by the customer. to meet the business imperative of cloud migration organizations need a network security solution in the cloud that offers advanced protection flexibility and predictable costs. however organizations that are accelerating their cloud adoption may not have the resources skills  or time to build scale or adapt their cloud security to meet the pace of their business. a managed firewall service allows organizations to offload cloud security infrastructure maintenance get deep visibility apply robust controls and optimize cloud security spend. a cloudnative managed firewall service removes the heavy lifting around network security operations and provides a frictionless experience to help customers easily deploy enterprisegrade security on the public cloud. cloud migration requires organizations to secure key cloud services. a nextgeneration managed firewall service or network firewallasaservice fwaas simplifies security management with full visibility across environments and broad protection across cloud workloads and applications. whether a managed firewall service or a network fwaas it is critical that organizations ensure that their public cloud workloads are protected by nextgeneration security solutions powered by comprehensive threat intelligence. with bad actors increasingly using generative pretrained transformers gpt and other ai technologies to create new more compelling exploits and threats faster than ever security teams must also leverage ai technologies to fight fire with fire. aipowered threat intelligence is arguably the most important use case as it can help organizations remain in lockstep with emerging threats. thats why cybersecurity vendors including fortinet are escalating their ai capabilities. to stay ahead of the curve it leaders should ask their providers how theyre applying ai what technologies their ai tools use and most importantly how their applications contribute to one or more of the benefits below cloud workload security signifies the security of data applications and all the infrastructure in cloud environments. it is a leading trend in nextgen network security because of the increasing usage of cloud applications. organizations are transitioning to the cloud and prioritizing visibility risk mitigation and integration with devops to ensure secure distributed workloads across containers virtual machines and serverless environments. cloud workload security helps them achieve the goal by providing realtime threat detection and continuous network security without impacting performance. mobile devices have become a vital part of everyday work and therefore organizations are focusing on security trends like building mobile security policies. the goal is to create a secure work environment even when employees access data through mobile devices. organizations are offering employee training and leveraging mobile device management tools to monitor and secure devices. moreover they are creating and teaching employees the best practices for protecting sensitive data and reducing risks associated with mobile device use. hybrid it network environments include multiple threat surfaces by combining onpremises equipment at corporate sites cloud environments and remote access by workfromanywhere usersall of which add complexity to network security management. to solve this problem a hybrid mesh firewall addresses network security with a unified security platform that provides coordinated protection across multiple areas of enterprise it to secure corporate sites such as branches campuses and data centers public and private clouds and remote access points. to do this hybrid mesh firewalls come in various form factors including appliances virtual machines cloudnative firewalls and firewallasaservice fwaas. sdwan provides secure reliable connectivity between branch and remote locations. secure sdwan extends that protection to cloudfirst securitysensitive global enterprises and their hybrid workforces. using one operating system secure sdwan consolidates functions across sdwan nextgeneration firewall ngfw advanced routing and ztna application gateway to simplify management and secure networking while enabling organizations to implement a robust sdwan security architecture for comprehensive protection. secure sdwan is the foundation for a seamless transition to sase and sdbranch. it enables organizations to protect their investment and simplify operations along their journey to a zero trust architecture . a secure access service edge sase architecture converges networking and several clouddelivered secure service edge solutions to protect distributed networks with advanced cybersecurity at every endpointedge. sdwan is the networking component and fwaas swg  casb and ztna comprise the edge security of sase. the advantage of a sase architecture is that it provides users with secure connections without the latency that results from backlogging traffic all the way to the central data center. a unified sase solution seamlessly integrates essential networking and security technologies delivered via the cloud. it ensures secure access for hybrid workers and safeguards applications and data on any cloud. a single operating system unifies the sase components enabling seamless and complete convergence of networking and security. unifed sase secures access to the internet corporate resources and saas applications no matter the users or resources locations. according to the national institute of standards and technology nist a zero trust architecture zta uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location i.e. local area networks versus the internet or based on asset ownership enterprise or personally owned. authentication and authorization of both subject and device are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users bring your own device byod  iot and cloudbased assets that are not located within an enterpriseowned network boundary. zero trust focuses on protecting resources assets services workflows network accounts etc. not network segments as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. ztna is a capability that controls access to applications. it extends the principles of zta to verify users and devices before every application session. ztna confirms that they meet the organizations policy before they can access that application. however ztna may work differently depending on where a user is located meaning that access to applications or networks may work from one location but fail from another. in contrast universal ztna enables secure connections regardless of the location of the network or user. users can work from anywhere and administrators can apply zerotrust principles without having to worry about the quality of network connections. universal ztna improves security and connectivity regardless of where users are locatedonpremise or remote or the type of network architecture. stay ahead with aipowered nextgen network security solutions designed to detect prevent and mitigate cyber threats in realtime. fortify your network with fortinet today . here are the top eight best practices for network security regular security audits help organizations identify and detect vulnerabilities before they escalate keeping network infrastructure secure. dividing the network into small multiple segments enables granular control over data flow and access. this reduces the attack surface and contains potential damage within isolated segments. implementing mfa which adds an extra verification step before granting access combined with strong passwords can reduce unauthorized access and strengthen network security. vpns encrypt traffic between remote users and the network establishing secure connections and safeguarding sensitive data over the internet. the zerotrust security framework works on the principle of never trust always verify assuming no device is secure. it verifies each device in the network before granting access thus minimizing the chances of breaches. a least privilege access policy limits users access and provides only the minimum level of access required to perform a job. this minimizes the attack surface safeguarding sensitive data. implement strong encryption protocols and strict authentication policies and continuously monitor the wireless network. according to the fortinet 2023 cloud security report  43 of companies state that talent shortage is their biggest challenge in securing cloud workloads. so its crucial to educate the employees about what is network security how to identify cyberattacks like phishing and social engineering and steps to take after an incident. network security defines an organizations readiness to combat everevolving cyber threats and its seriousness to safeguard the integrity of its data and that of its customers from unauthorized access. the basic password encryption approach is no longer relevant and cannot prevent threats. statista reveals that data breaches are among the top concerns of company leaders. around 422.61 million data records were compromised in the third quarter of 2024. such incidents can damage a companys reputation and lead to the loss of customer trust in the long term. therefore implementing strong and advanced network security measures and tools is crucial to preventing these breaches and safeguarding sensitive data. fortinets fortigate nextgeneration firewall ngfw provides aidriven threat intelligence for proactive defense and protection against cyber attacks. its purposebuilt asics called security processing units spus ensure fastspeed security processing making fortigate a trustworthy and reliable solution for modern network security needs. vulnerabilities in your network security give hackers an opening to do untold damage to your network while exposing potentially sensitive and confidential information. network security protection has been developed to implement measures to protect your computer networks data from being lost stolen or manipulated. a computer network provides communication and enables the sharing of information to multiple users within a network. network security technologies work within several layers to protect your network as a whole against any potential threats. some of the common network security threats include phishing scams malicious software malware and distributed denial of service ddos. cybersecurity is a broader field that covers different security measures and threats while network security is a specific subset focused on protecting the communication infrastructure and ensuring secure data transmission across networks. network security policies act as a framework for maintaining a secure network. they guide technical setups and user behavior to ensure the network remains protected from potential threats. please fill out the form and a knowledgeable representative will get in touch

https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-network-security.html,what is network security  cisco,network security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access misuse or theft. it involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices applications users and applications to work in a secure manner. network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. each network security layer implements policies and controls. authorized users gain access to network resources but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats. digitization has transformed our world. how we live work play and learn have all changed. every organization that wants to deliver the services that customers and employees demand must protect its network. network security also helps you protect proprietary information from attack. ultimately it protects your reputation. a firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. cisco offers both threatfocused firewalls and unified threat management utm devices. workload security protects workloads moving across different cloud and hybrid environments. these distributed workloads have larger attack surfaces which must be secured without affecting the agility of the business. network security is ciscos vision for simplifying network workload and multicloud security by delivering unified security controls to dynamic environments. softwaredefined segmentation puts network traffic into different classifications and makes enforcing security policies easier. ideally the classifications are based on endpoint identity not mere ip addresses. you can assign access rights based on role location and more so that the right level of access is given to the right people and suspicious devices are contained and remediated. a virtual private network encrypts the connection from an endpoint to a network often over the internet. typically a remoteaccess vpn uses ipsec or secure sockets layer to authenticate the communication between device and network. not every user should have access to your network. to keep out potential attackers you need to recognize each user and each device. then you can enforce your security policies. you can block noncompliant endpoint devices or give them only limited access. this process is network access control nac. malware short for malicious software includes viruses worms trojans ransomware and spyware. sometimes malware will infect a network but lie dormant for days or even weeks. the best antimalware programs not only scan for malware upon entry but also continuously track files afterward to find anomalies remove malware and fix damage. any software you use to run your business needs to be protected whether your it staff builds it or whether you buy it. unfortunately any application may contain holes or vulnerabilities that attackers can use to infiltrate your network. application security encompasses the hardware software and processes you use to close those holes. to detect abnormal network behavior you must know what normal behavior looks like. behavioral analytics tools automatically discern activities that deviate from the norm. your security team can then better identify indicators of compromise that pose a potential problem and quickly remediate threats. cloud security is a broad set of technologies policies and applications applied to defend online ip services applications and other imperative data. it helps you better manage your security by shielding users against threats anywhere they access the internet and securing your data and applications in the cloud. organizations must make sure that their staff does not send sensitive information outside the network. data loss prevention or dlp technologies can stop people from uploading forwarding or even printing critical information in an unsafe manner. email gateways are the number one threat vector for a security breach. attackers use personal information and social engineering tactics to build sophisticated phishing campaigns to deceive recipients and send them to sites serving up malware. an email security application blocks incoming attacks and controls outbound messages to prevent the loss of sensitive data. as you are digitizing your industrial operations the deeper integration between it cloud and industrial networks is exposing your industrial control systems ics to cyberthreats. you need full visibility into your ot security posture to segment the industrial network and feed it security tools with rich details on ot devices and behaviors. cybercriminals are increasingly targeting mobile devices and apps. within the next three years 90 percent of it organizations may support corporate applications on personal mobile devices. of course you need to control which devices can access your network. you will also need to configure their connections to keep network traffic private. siem products pull together the information that your security staff needs to identify and respond to threats. these products come in various forms including physical and virtual appliances and server software. a web security solution will control your staffs web use block webbased threats and deny access to malicious websites. it will protect your web gateway on site or in the cloud. web security also refers to the steps you take to protect your own website. wireless networks are not as secure as wired ones. without stringent security measures installing a wireless lan can be like putting ethernet ports everywhere including the parking lot. to prevent an exploit from taking hold you need products specifically designed to protect a wireless network.,862
https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/what-is/network-security/network-security-basics.html,what are network security basics  trend micro us,network security basics are the critical elements of network or cyber security. they should be implemented within all networks including home business and internet. effective network security requires protection of wired and wireless networks with firewalls antimalware software intrusion detection systems access control and more. network security is a complex topic that involves many different technologies with configurations that are sometimes complicated. the security issue to address is the separation between what is on the network and the endpoints or host systems that are attached to it. the technology for both the network and the endpoints includes access control and encryption but on the network there is also segmentation and perimeter security. network security is only part of the security equation and it is usually considered to apply to the devices that protect the network itself. a firewall can be a standalone device that sits beside networking equipment such as routers or switches or software within the same physical box that also routes andor switches. on the network there are firewalls intrusion detection systems ids intrusion prevention systems ips virtual private network vpn appliances data leak prevention dlp systems etc. the network exists to connect systems to each other. it is what enables you to browse amazon or shop online at your local grocery store. but end systems must also be protected that is called endpoint security. these devices include laptops tablets phones but also the internet of things iot devices. iot includes devices such as connected thermostats cameras refrigerators front door locks light bulbs pool pumps smart duvets etc. these devices require security controls as well but not all devices are sophisticated enough to contain something like a hostbased firewall or antimalware agent. if the endpoint is a light bulb then it probably relies on network security for its protection. the first place to start is with access control. businesses commonly referred to this as identity and access management iam. controlling access is not new. humans have controlled access to buildings since the first lock was installed on a door over six thousand years ago. access control is now performed on networks computers phones applications websites and files. fundamentally access control is broken down into iaaa within iaaa authentication might be the most important topic today. passwords are still the most common authentication on most systems. they are typically not very secure however because they are easy to crack. if a password is short enough the hacker has little trouble figuring out what it is. hackers use a passwordguessing attack that entails brute force  trying all possible combinations. or the attacker could use a passwordcracking attack which entails using a program to recreate passwords that hash to the same value. there are three authentication types or factors in use today. they are the best choice is twofactor authentication 2fa sometimes referred to as multifactor authentication mfa. we highly recommended it for your personal accounts such as amazon or facebook. applications such as the google authenticator are free to use and a much better choice than receiving a text or short message service sms message to your phone. the national institute of standards and technology nist recommends against sms. we also recommend 2fa for the office but it is a decision at a policy or management level to require this or not. it depends on many factors such as the asset its data classification the risks and the vulnerabilities. network segmentation improves security by controlling the flow of data between different networks. this is most commonly accomplished with virtual local area networks vlans. there are many variations on this theme such as private virtual lan pvlan virtual extensible lan vxlan and so on. a vlan exists at the data link layer  layer 2 of the open system interconnect osi model. most network administrators map an internet protocol ip subnet to a vlan. routers enable traffic to pass between vlans according to the configuration. if you want control router configuration is critical. another option found within the cloud is called a virtual private cloud vpc. traffic control to and from the vpc is also controlled by configurations. understanding the business requirements for the workload is essential to configure and control access to or from vlans and vpcs. perimeter security is based on the logic that there is a defined edge between an internaltrusted network and an externaluntrusted network. this is traditional network design that dates to when the network and data center were confined within a single building. in this configuration a router connects the internal and external networks. basic configuration of an access control list acl within the router controls the traffic that can pass through. you can add security at the perimeter with firewalls ids and ips. for more information on these see the network security measures page. encryption is essential to keep sensitive data and communications away from prying eyes. encryption protects files on your computers hard drive a banking session data stored in the cloud sensitive emails and a long list of other applications. cryptography also provides verification of data integrity and authentication of the datas source. encryption falls into two basic types of cryptography symmetric and asymmetric. a third topic is hashing. even though it is not encryption it needs to be included at this point in security discussions. hashing runs an algorithm against a message that calculates a resultant answer called the hash that is based on the bits of that message. bits can be data voice or video. hashing does not change the value of the data in any way. in contrast encryption alters the data to an unreadable state. hashing proves that the bits of the message have not changed. it ensures the data has integrity and that it is in its original format. only hashing protects data from accidental changes. if the hash is encrypted with an asymmetric private key it proves that a hacker has not maliciously tampered with the data. malicious changes cannot occur unless the private key is compromised. if the key has not been compromised then you know that the person who has the private key must be the person who calculated the hash. that key could be a symmetric key which is sometimes referred to as a private key or the asymmetric private key. it is difficult to protect data voice or video transmitted over a wireless network. wireless transmissions are intended to emit a signal and this makes it easier for a hacker within range to capture the transmission. there are encryption standards for wireless but most have been broken in one way or another. encryption standards include wep wpa wpa2 and now wpa3. network security is complex. it is an unending battle of wits against the hackers. see the network security measures page for more information. it is always a great idea to pursue security certifications. either the comptia security certification or the system security certified practitioner  isc 2 sscp  certification is a great starting point. a more advanced managerlevel certification with a bit of technical knowledge thrown in is the certified information system security professional  isc 2 cissp  certification. you can also take vendorspecific exams such as the cloudbased exams for aws  gcp  or azure . experience our

important and keeping up with new threats as they appear. to prevent phishing attacks and scams in 2025 businesses need to combine training that you can do with tools that can change as threats do. think about more than just surface screens. think about finding malware protecting against spoofing and scanning that happens in real time. and your defenses need to stay just as smart as phishing techniques get smarter especially since ai can now make fake websites and messages that look and feel real. sender behavior message structure and embedded link or attachment content are just a few of the indications that advanced phishing protection technologies look for. heuristic scanning sandbox analysis url reputation checks and artificial intelligence are some of the methods they utilize to identify dangers that are typically missed by standard filters. these phishing protection tools work by analyzing multiple signals  not just content but behavior link structure domain reputation and spoofing indicators in real time. disconnect from the network run a security scan and alert your it or security team immediately. phishing attacks are so effective because they target the person not the system. and while awareness is essential protection against phishing attacks has to account for the moments when someone still clicks. some phishing attacks in your inbox will still get through. a convincing message a fake login page a welltimed request. thats all it takes. you need defenses built around the user. real protection uses multiple controls working together. not just one filter. not just a warning banner. a strong email security platform can spot and block these threats as they happen. the good ones dont wait for a signature update. they learn adapt and react in real time. prevention starts with seeing phishing attacks as a part of a system not just a message. it is crucial to prioritize team email security training  strengthen your filters and assume some attacks will get through. engaging in email security best practices is important but this alone will not prevent a successful phishing attack says guardian digital ceo dave wreski. a fully integrated email security solution that delivers total endtoend control is critical to safeguard business email accounts. the right system doesnt just block spam. it catches the sophisticated threats. the quiet

protection checklist  preventing phishing phishing protection checklist  preventing phishing 1 year ago inspired elearning it security  phishing  security awareness by david bloxberg  senior global marketing manager vipre security group first what is phishing phishing pronounced like fishing is a method cybercriminals use to steal personal information. its a widespread form of identity theft that can be difficult to detect. scammers often disguise their attempts as legitimate emails or websites tricking individuals into sharing sensitive details. these include credit card numbers social security numbers login credentials passwords and phone numbers. to protect yourself its crucial to approach unexpected emails and suspicious links cautiously and know how to respond if you accidentally engage in a phishing attempt . why phishing is a growing problem in 2024 phishing attacks have become more sophisticated making them one of the most effective tools for cybercriminals. todays phishing emails are often from trusted sources like your bank or a wellknown company. they can include professional logos convincing email addresses and even advanced html designs. this high level of professionalism can easily fool people into clicking on links that lead to fraudulent websites where scammers steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. one of the reasons phishing is so successful is that cybercriminals have evolved their tactics. in 2024 phishing attacks have expanded to target email users mobile devices and other communication platforms. according to recent reports  57 of organizations experience phishing attempts on a weekly or daily basis. an alarming 1.2 of emails are malicious translating to around 3.4 billion daily phishing emails. phishing attacks account for 36 of data breaches and 83 of organizations fall victim to at least one phishing attack annually. scammers also use advanced technologies including ai to craft highly personalized and convincing phishing messages. aigenerated phishing attempts can be difficult to spot because they mimic human language and behavior so well. this technological shift makes it more challenging than ever for individuals and organizations to detect and prevent attacks. in 2023 nearly 50 of professionals encountered business email compromise bec attacks with 35 of all cyberattacks resulting from bec phishing . these sophisticated attacks aim to steal login credentials or financial information and have resulted in substantial financial losses 17700 is lost each minute due to phishing attacks. large organizations especially those with 10000 or more employees spend an average of 3.7 million annually dealing with phishingrelated incidents. in 2024 phishing attacks have also become more diverse. deceptive links remain the top strategy accounting for 36 of phishing attempts but attackers are now using multiple channels including mobile apps and social media. notably the use of ai in phishing has created convincing fake login pages and emails that are nearly impossible to distinguish from the real thing. the sheer volume and sophistication of phishing attacks make it a serious threat to businesses and individuals alike. as attackers continue to innovate with new tools and tactics vigilance and updated cybersecurity practices are critical to staying ahead of these everevolving threats. types of phishing attacks understanding different phishing attacks can help businesses protect sensitive information and save money. you can gain peace of mind by guarding against cybercrimes and implementing phishing protection. its especially valuable for business ownersallowing you to focus time energy and resources on growing your company instead of dealing with security breaches. email phishing email remains a standard vehicle for phishing attacks . cybercriminals send mass emails hoping even a few recipients will fall for their scams. with 30 of phishing emails being opened the scale can be staggering if emails are sent to thousands or millions of users. spear phishing spear phishing is a form of targeted phishing that involves detailed research. scammers gather information about a specific persons contacts and customize a phishing email to make it appear as though its from a trusted colleague friend or family member. this personalization increases the likelihood of the victim sharing personally identifyable information or clicking on malicious links. social media phishing social media phishing occurs when scammers create fake profiles that mimic a users real friends. the attacker might send a new friend request making it appear that the individual is starting over with a fresh account. this approach is designed to collect personal information or scam the victims contacts. smishing sms phishing smishing involves sending fraudulent messages via sms or text messaging. these messages often contain malicious links or ask for personal information pretending to be from legitimate organizations such as banks or service providers. many users are unaware that phishing attempts can come through text making this an increasingly common tactic. vishing voice phishing vishing uses phone calls to trick victims into revealing personal information or financial details. scammers often impersonate trusted institutions like banks or government agencies using urgency or fear to manipulate their targets. the lack of visual cues over the phone can make it easier for criminals to deceive their victims. whaling whaling is a targeted phishing attack aimed at highprofile individuals such as executives or government officials. the emails in whaling attacks are crafted to seem highly relevant and credible often focusing on business or legal matters. the goal is to trick these highvalue targets into transferring funds or disclosing sensitive information. zishing zoom phishing zishing a relatively new form of phishing  targets users of video conferencing platforms like zoom microsoft teams or google meet. in a zishing attack scammers send fake meeting invitations or links to join a video call. these links often mimic legitimate meeting platforms tricking victims into entering their login credentials or downloading malware. given the widespread adoption of virtual meetings this method has become increasingly popular as many users are less vigilant about verifying meeting invitations especially during a busy workday. falling for a zishing scam can lead to compromised accounts and leaked sensitive information shared in virtual meetings. looking to protect your business from phishing attacks let the experts at inspired elearning help safeguard your organization with

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD-WAN,sdwan  wikipedia,a softwaredefined wide area network  sdwan  is a wide area network that uses softwaredefined networking technology such as communicating over the internet using overlay tunnels which are encrypted when destined for internal organization locations.  1  if standard tunnel setup and configuration messages are supported by all of the network hardware vendors sdwan simplifies the management and operation of a wan by decoupling the networking hardware from its control mechanism. this concept is similar to how softwaredefined networking implements virtualization technology to improve data center management and operation.  1  in practice proprietary protocols are used to set up and manage an sdwan meaning there is no decoupling of the hardware and its control mechanism. a key application of sdwan is to allow companies to build higherperformance wans using lowercost and commercially available internet access  enabling businesses to partially or wholly replace more expensive private wan connection technologies such as mpls .  1  when sdwan traffic is carried over the internet there are no endtoend performance guarantees. carrier mpls vpn wan services are not carried as internet traffic  but rather over carefully controlled carrier capacity and do come with an endtoend performance guarantee.  citation needed  wans were very important for the development of networking in general and for a long time one of the most important applications of networks both for military and enterprise applications.  2  the ability to communicate data over long distances was one of the main driving factors for the development of data communications as it made it possible to overcome the distance limitations as well as shortening the time necessary to exchange messages with other parties. legacy wans allowed communication over circuits connecting two or more endpoints. earlier networking supported pointtopoint communication over a slow speed circuit usually between two fixed locations. as networking progressed wan circuits became faster and more flexible. innovations like circuit and packet switching in the form of x.25  atm and later internet protocol or multiprotocol label switching  allowed communication to become more dynamic supporting evergrowing networks.  3  the need for strict control security and quality of service qos meant that multinational corporations were very conservative in leasing and operating their wans. national regulations restricted the companies that could provide local service in each country and complex arrangements were necessary to establish truly global networks. all that changed with the growth of the internet  which permitted entities around the world to connect to each other. however over the first years the uncontrolled nature of the internet was not considered adequate or safe for private corporate use. independent of safety concerns connectivity to the internet became a necessity to the point where every branch required internet access. at first due to safety concerns private communications were still done via wan and communication with other entities including customers and partners moved to the internet. as the internet grew in reach and maturity companies started to evaluate how to leverage it for private corporate communications. during the early 2000s application delivery over the wan became an important topic of research and commercial innovation.  4  over the next decade increasing computing power made it possible to create softwarebased appliances that were able to analyze traffic and make informed decisions without delays making it possible to create largescale overlay networks over the public internet that could replicate all the functionality of legacy wans at a fraction of the cost. sdwan combines several networking aspects to create fullfledged private networks with the ability to dynamically share network bandwidth across the connection points.  1  additional enhancements include central controllers zerotouch provisioning  integrated analytics and ondemand circuit provisioning with some network intelligence based in the cloud  allowing centralized policy management and security.  5  networking publications started using the term sdwan to describe this new networking trend as early as 2014.  6  with the rapid shift to remote work as a result of lockdowns and stay at home orders during the covid19 pandemic sdwan grew in popularity as a way of connecting remote workers.  7  wans allow companies to extend their computer networks over large distances connecting remote branch offices to data centers and to each other and delivering applications and services required to perform business functions. due to the physical constraints imposed by the propagation time over large distances and the need to integrate multiple service providers to cover global geographies often crossing nation boundaries wans face important operational challenges including network congestion  packet delay variation   8  packet loss   9  and even service outages. modern applications such as voip calling videoconferencing  streaming media  and virtualized applications and desktops require low latency .  10  bandwidth requirements are also increasing especially for applications featuring highdefinition video .  11  it can be expensive and difficult to expand wan capability with corresponding difficulties related to network management and troubleshooting.  1  sdwan products are designed to address these network problems.  6  by enhancing or even replacing traditional branch routers with virtualization appliances that can control applicationlevel policies and offer a network overlay less expensive consumergrade internet links can act more like a dedicated circuit. this simplifies the setup process for branch personnel.  12  sdwan products can be physical appliances or software based only.  13  the mef forum has defined an sdwan architecture consisting of an sdwan edge sdwan gateway sdwan controller and sdwan orchestrator.  5  the sdwan edge is a physical or virtual network function that is placed at an organizations branchregionalcentral office site data center and in public or private cloud platforms.  5  mef forum has published the first sdwan service standard mef 70  14  which defines the fundamental characteristics of an sdwan service plus service requirements and attributes. sdwan gateways provide access to the sdwan service in order to shorten the distance to cloudbased services or the user and reduce service interruptions.  15  a distributed network of gateways may be included in an sdwan service by the vendor or setup and maintained by the organization using the service.  15  by sitting outside the headquarters in the cloud the gateway also reduces headquarters traffic.  15  the sdwan orchestrator is a cloud hosted or onpremises web management tool that allows configuration provisioning and other functions when operating an sdwan. it simplifies application traffic management by allowing central implementation of an organizations business policies.  16  the sdwan controller functionality which can be placed in the orchestrator or in an sdwan gateway is used to make forwarding decisions for application flows.  14  application flows are ip packets that have been classified to determine their user application or grouping of applications to which they are associated. the grouping of application flows based on a common type e.g. conferencing applications is referred to as an application flow group in mef 70. per mef 70 the sdwan edge classifies incoming ip packets at the sdwan uni sdwan user network interface  14  determines via osi layer 2 through layer 7 classification which application flow the ip packets belong to and then applies the policies to block the application flow or allow the application flows to be forwarded based on the availability of a route to the destination sdwan uni on a remote sdwan edge. this helps ensure that application performance meets service level agreements slas.  17  he gartner research firm has defined an sdwan as having four required characteristics  1  features of sdwans include resilience quality of service qos security and performance with flexible deployment options simplified administration and troubleshooting and online traffic engineering. a resilient sdwan reduces network downtime. to be resilient the technology must feature realtime detection of outages and automatic switch over fail over to working links.  18  sdwan technology supports quality of service by having application level awareness giving bandwidth priority to the most critical applications. this may include dynamic path selection sending an application on a faster link or even splitting an application between two paths to improve performance by delivering it faster.  5  sdwan communication is usually secured using ipsec  a staple of wan security.  19  sdwans can improve application delivery using caching  storing recently accessed information in memory to speed future access.  20  sdwans can incorporate artificial intelligence for it operations aiops for continuous troubleshooting and fixes to network issues.  21  most sdwan products are available as preconfigured appliances placed at the network edge in data centers branch offices and other remote locations. there are also virtual appliances that can work on existing network hardware or the appliance can be deployed as a virtual appliance on the cloud in environments such as amazon web services aws unified communications as a service ucaas or as software as a service saas.  22  this allows enterprises to benefit from sdwan services as they migrate application delivery from corporate servers to cloud based services such as salesforce.com and google apps.  13  as with network equipment in general guis may be preferred to command line interface cli methods of configuration and control.  23  other beneficial administrative features include automatic path selection the ability to centrally configure each end appliance by pushing configuration changes out and even a true software defined networking approach that lets all appliances and virtual appliances be configured centrally based on application needs rather than underlying hardware.  1  with a global view of network status a controller that manages sdwan can perform careful and adaptive traffic engineering by assigning new transfer requests according to current usage of resources links. for example this can be achieved by performing central calculation of transmission rates at the controller and ratelimiting at the senders endpoints according to such rates.  24   25   26   27   28  sdwan is a core component of secure access service edge solutions sase which incorporate network and security capabilities to more efficiently and securely connect distributed work environments branch office headquarters home office remote to distributed applications located in data centers cloud infrastructure or delivered by saas services. with sase sdwan is combined with other network and security technologies including cloud access security broker casb secure web gateway  data loss prevention dlp zero trust network access  ztna  firewall and other capabilities to connect and protect users and applications. in december 2021 gartner research firm estimated that by 2025 50 of sdwan purchases will be part of a single vendor sase offering.  29  there are some similarities between sdwan and wan optimization  the name given to the collection of techniques used to increase datatransfer efficiencies across wans. the goal of each is to accelerate application delivery between branch offices and data centers but sdwan technology focuses additionally on cost savings and efficiency specifically by allowing lower cost network links to perform the work of more expensive leased lines whereas wan optimization focuses squarely on improving packet delivery. an sdwan utilizing virtualization techniques assisted with wan optimization traffic control allows network bandwidth to dynamically grow or shrink as needed. sdwan technology and wan optimization can be used separately or together  30  and some sdwan vendors are adding wan optimization features to their products.  20   31  a wan edge router is a device that routes data packets between different wan locations giving enterprise access to a carrier network. also called a boundary router it is unlike a core router which only sends packets within a single network.  32  sdwans can work as an overlay to simplify the management of existing wan edge routers by lowering dependence on routing protocols.  6  sdwan can also potentially be an alternative to wan edge routers.  12  sdwans are similar to hybrid wans and sometimes the terms are used interchangeably but they are not identical. a hybrid wan consists of different connection types and may have a software defined network sdn component but doesnt have to.  33  cloudbased sdwan offers advanced features such as enhanced security seamless cloud and support for mobile users that result naturally from the use of cloud infrastructure. as a result cloudbased sdwan can replace mpls enabling organizations to release resources once tied to wan investments and create new capabilities.  34  an overview discussing three typical reasons to compare mpls with sdwan. specifically where it teams need to retain mpls due to contract commitments and where the enterprise migrates from mpls to an internetbased sd wan.  35  as there is no standard algorithm for sdwan controllers device manufacturers each use their own proprietary algorithm in the transmission of data. these algorithms determine which traffic to direct over which link and when to switch traffic from one link to another. given the breadth of options available in relation to both software and hardware sdwan control solutions its imperative they be tested and validated under realworld conditions within a lab setting prior to deployment.  citation needed  there are multiple solutions available for testing purposes ranging from purposebuilt network emulation appliances which can apply specified network impairments to the network being tested in order to reliably validate performance to softwarebased solutions.  citation needed  network world it website divides the sdwan vendor market into three groups established networking vendors who are adding sdwan products to their offerings wan specialists who are starting to integrate sdwan functionality into their products and startups focused specifically on the sdwan market.  1  the global sdwan market stood at 3.25 billion in 2021 and the market is expected to grow 30 in 2022. according to sdwan market report datavagyanik north america accounted for more than 77 of the market.  36  alternatively a market overview by nemertes research groups sdwan vendors into categories based on their original technology space and which are pureplay sdwan providers wan optimization vendors linkaggregation vendors and general network vendors.  30  while network worlds second category startups focused specifically on the sdwan market is generally equivalent to nemertes pureplay sdwan providers category nemertes offers a more detailed view of the preexisting wan and overall networking providers.  citation needed  additionally nemertes research also describes the innet side of the sdwan market describing the gotomarket strategy of connectivity providers entering the sdwan market. these providers include networkasaservice vendors carriers or telcos content delivery networks and secure wan providers.  citation needed  mef 70 standardizes sdwan service attributes and uses standard ipv4 and ipv6 routing protocols. sdwan services also use standard ipsec encryption protocols. additional standardization for other sdwan functions and related security functionality not covered in mef 70 are under development at the mef forum. there are several opensource sdwan solutions and opensource sdwan implementations available. for example the linux foundation has three projects that intersect with and help the sdwan market onap  opendaylight project  and the tungsten fabric formerly juniper networks  opencontrail.,2401
https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/networking/what-is-sd-wan.html,what is sdwan  softwaredefined wan sdwan  cisco,the traditional wan widearea network function was to connect users at the branch or campus to applications hosted on servers in the data center. typically dedicated multiprotocol label switching  mpls  circuits were used to help ensure security and reliable connectivity. this doesnt work in a cloudcentric world. times have changed. as businesses adopt the use of softwareasaservice  saas  and infrastructureasaservice iaas applications in multiple clouds it is realizing that the user application experience is poor. that is because wans designed for a different era are not ready for the unprecedented explosion of wan traffic that cloud adoption brings. that traffic causes management complexity applicationperformance unpredictability and data vulnerability. further opening the enterprise to the internet and the cloud exposes major threat and compliance issues. it is extremely challenging to protect the critical assets of an enterprise when applications are accessed by a diverse workforce including employees partners contractors vendors and guests. enabling broadband on the wan makes the security requirements more acute creating challenges for it in balancing user experience security and complexity. new business models drive the need for a new network model. sdwan addresses the current it challenges. this new approach to network connectivity can lower operational costs and improve resource usage for multisite deployments. network administrators can use bandwidth more efficiently and can help ensure high levels of performance for critical applications without sacrificing security or data privacy. the traditional wan architecture was limited to enterprise branch and data center. once an organization adopts cloudbased applications in the form of saas and iaas its wan architecture experiences an explosion of traffic accessing applications distributed across the globe. these changes have multiple implications for it. employee productivity may be compromised by saasapplication performance problems. wan expenses can rise with inefficient use of dedicated and backup circuits. it fights a daily complex battle of connecting multiple types of users with multiple types of devices to multiple cloud environments. with sdwan it can deliver routing threat protection efficient offloading of expensive circuits and simplification of wan network management. business benefits can include the following sdwan evolved from mpls technology which has powered private connectivity for more than two decades. in many ways sdwan can be seen as a software abstraction of mpls technology thats applicable to wider scenarios it brings secure private connectivity thats agnostic to all kinds of links and providers and is cloudaware. while mpls handled failure scenarios with backup links sdwan handles them with realtime traffic steering based on centralized policy. also since sdwan unifies the entire wan backbone it delivers comprehensive analytics across the network globally. this wasnt possible before because of disparate pieces of infrastructure and policy. sdwan can be seen as software defined networking sdn for the wan. it represents arguably the most popular and widely deployed use case in sdn. the sdn model became popular for abstracting network infrastructure in the data center and other sections within the enterprise perimeter. sdwan played a similar role but needed to abstract infrastructure elements that were diverse in terms of link types providers and geographies. since it crossed the enterprise perimeter it needed a robust security component as well. extend intentbased networking across the branch wan and cloud. for lean it teams meraki simplifies branch management and integrates threat management.,544

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software,remote desktop software  wikipedia,in computing  the term remote desktop refers to a software  or operating system feature that allows a personal computer s desktop environment to be run remotely from one system usually a pc but the concept applies equally to a server or a smartphone  while being displayed on a separate client device . remote desktop applications have varying features. some allow attaching to an existing users session and remote controlling either displaying the remote control session or blanking the screen. taking over a desktop remotely is a form of remote administration. remote access can also be explained as the remote control of a computer by using another device connected via the internet or another network. this is widely used by many computer manufacturers and large businesses help desks for technical troubleshooting of their customers problems. remote desktop software captures the mouse and keyboard inputs from the local computer client and sends them to the remote computer server.  1  the remote computer in turn sends the display commands to the local computer. when applications with many graphics including video or 3d models need to be controlled remotely a remote workstation software that sends the pixels rather than the display commands must be used to provide a smooth likelocal experience. remote desktop sharing is accomplished through a common clientserver model. the client or vnc viewer is installed on a local computer and then connects via a network to a server component which is installed on the remote computer. in a typical vnc session all keystrokes and mouse clicks are registered as if the client were actually performing tasks on the enduser machine.  2  remote desktops also have a major advantage for security development companies are able to permit software engineers who may be dispersed geographically to operate and develop from a computer which can be held within the companies office or cloud environment. the target computer in a remote desktop scenario is still able to access all of its core functions. many of these core functions including the main clipboard  can be shared between the target computer and remote desktop client. following the onset of covid19  the shift to remotework environments has led many to work from home with devices without enterprise it support. as a result these workers were reliant on remote desktop software to collaborate and keep their systems available and secure.  3  a main use of remote desktop software is remote administration and remote implementation. this need arises when software buyers are far away from their software vendor. most remote access software can be used for  headless computers  instead of each computer having its own monitor keyboard and mouse or using a kvm switch  one computer can have a monitor keyboard mouse and remote control software and control many headless computers. the duplicate desktop mode is useful for user support and education. remote control software combined with telephone communication can be nearly as helpful for novice computerusers as if the support staff were actually there. remote desktop software can be used to access a remote computer a physical personal computer to which a user does not have physical access but that can be accessed or interacted with.  4  unlike servers  remote computers are mainly used for peer to peer connections where one device is unattended. a remote computer connection is generally only possible if both devices have a network connection. since the advent of cloud computing remote desktop software can be housed on usb hardware devices  allowing users to connect the device to any pc connected to their network or the internet and recreate their desktop via a connection to the cloud. this model avoids one problem with remote desktop software which requires the local computer to be switched on at the time when the user wishes to access it remotely. it is possible with a router with c2s vpn support and wake on lan equipment to establish a virtual private network vpn connection with the router over the internet if not connected to the lan  switch on a computer connected to the router then connect to it. remote desktop products are available in three models hosted service software and appliance. tech support scammers use remote desktop software to connect to their victims computer and will often lock out the computer if the victim does not cooperate. a remote access trojan  rat  sometimes called creepware   6  is a type of malware that controls a system through a remote network connection. while desktop sharing and remote administration have many legal uses rat connotes criminal or malicious activity. a rat is typically installed without the victims knowledge often as payload of a trojan horse  and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from computer security software and other antivirus software.  7   8   9   10   11   12 ,797

perimeterbased approachwhich trusts anything inside the network and focuses security on the perimeterztna continually verifies every access request regardless of location user or device. it assumes that every user device or network segment is a potential threat and enforces strong identitycentric access controls at every stage. zero trust network access ztna is a security model that provides secure adaptive and segmented access to applications and resources. it provides adaptable and resilient cybersecurity to secure access for the hybrid workforce at global scale. traditional security relies on securing the network perimeter while ztna treats every access attempt as potentially risky regardless of location. benefits include increased visibility into network activity scalability and flexibility and minimized impact of potential breaches. importance of ztna zero trust network access ztna is important because it aligns with the growing need for adaptable resilient cybersecurity in an increasingly distributed digitalfirst workplace. heres why it has become a critical framework protection against evolving threats. traditional security models which grant broad network access to internal users are insufficient against todays sophisticated cyberthreats especially insider threats or threats arising from compromised credentials. ztna assumes that no entity is inherently trusted limiting potential attack vectors. support for remote work and cloudbased resources. with the rise of remote work and cloud adoption businesses are shifting away from traditional onpremises networks to hybrid or fully cloudbased infrastructures. ztna provides secure access to resources from any location enforcing security policies consistently across onpremises and cloud environments. mitigation of lateral movement in cyberattacks. in a security breach scenario ztnas segmented access prevents lateral movement by attackers limiting the scope of potential damage. since access is granted only on a needtoknow basis attackers find it much more difficult to move between systems and gain access to critical assets. ztna provides numerous benefits for businesses including enhanced security. ztnas model of continuous identity and device verification reduces the risk of unauthorized access and mitigates threats from compromised credentials. by verifying each access attempt based on factors like identity location and device health ztna strengthens overall security posture and minimizes unauthorized access. improved access control and policy enforcement. ztna allows organizations to enforce granular rolebased access policies. users are granted access only to the applications or resources they need reducing the chances of accidental or intentional access to sensitive data. it also simplifies compliance with data protection and privacy regulations by ensuring that access is limited and logged. reduced attack surface. since ztna doesnt expose the entire network to any single user or device it reduces the attack surface significantly. only authorized users and devices can access specific resources and they can only access them via secure encrypted connections lowering the risk of a data breach or unauthorized exposure. ztna vs. traditional security models traditional security models primarily rely on the concept of a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network secured by firewalls and vpns. key differences between zero trust network access ztna and these traditional models include perimeterbased versus identitybased. traditional security relies on securing the network perimeter assuming users within the network are trusted. ztna treats every access attempt as potentially risky regardless of location requiring identity verification each time. implicit versus explicit trust. in traditional models once authenticated users are trusted and often move laterally within the network with little restriction. ztna however implements microsegmentation and leastprivilege access to limit lateral movement and reduce risks associated with compromised credentials. static versus dynamic access control. legacy security models typically have static rules which are less flexible and often outdated in todays environments. ztna uses dynamic policies that adapt based on risk factors user behavior and other contextual cues. vpn versus direct secure access. traditional network connectivity models often use vpns for remote access which can introduce latency and are challenging to scale. ztna solutions provide secure access directly to applications without routing all traffic through a vpn improving performance and scalability. mechanics of ztna zero trust network access ztna is part of the security service edge framework and is used to secure access to private resources built on zero trust principles. in a ztna environment users devices and applications must continuously prove their legitimacy before accessing resources regardless of their location within or outside the network. key operational mechanics include identity and access management . ztna starts with strict identity verification. each user or device must authenticate their identity often through multifactor authentication mfa before gaining access to any application or resource. this ensures only legitimate users are identified and granted access. microsegmentation. instead of relying on a single network perimeter ztna divides the network into smaller isolated segments. each segment contains specific resources or applications making it difficult for attackers to move laterally within the network if they compromise one segment. least privilege access. each user and device is granted access only to the specific applications or data necessary for their roles limiting potential exposure. this least privilege approach minimizes the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access by limiting what any one compromised account can access. applicationlevel access. rather than granting broad networklevel access ztna supports applicationspecific connections. this means that even if a device is granted access it only communicates with the specific application or resource its authorized to access. it further reduces the attack surface as users and devices dont have visibility or access to the entire network. continuous access evaluation. continuous evaluation of user and device behavior is a central component of ztna. this includes monitoring for any unusual activity patterns device posture such as whether security updates are installed and changes in location. when anomalies are detected access may be revoked or additional authentication required. benefits benefits of zero trust network access zero trust network access ztna offers a range of benefits. its an attractive security framework given todays increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. increased visibility ztna provides a centralized view of all access requests and network activity enabling realtime monitoring and auditing. this visibility is critical for identifying and mitigating risks early as well as for compliance reporting and understanding user behavior patterns. scalability and flexibility ztnas cloudbased approach to security is scalable and adaptable. as a business grows adds resources or adopts new applications ztna accommodates these changes without requiring extensive reconfigurations. it supports a hybrid workforce by providing seamless secure access regardless of users locations. minimized impact of potential breaches by limiting access to specific applications and isolating the network ztna minimizes the scope of potential damage in case of a breach. should an attacker gain access theyre typically contained to the specific segment they infiltrated reducing the risk of significant data loss or operational disruption. ease of demonstrating compliance by limiting access to only authorized users and continuously monitoring activity ztna helps organizations meet regulatory standards for data security and protection such as gdpr hipaa and pcidss. its finegrained access controls provide a clear audit trail for demonstrating compliance. reduced risk of insider threats with the least privilege access model ztna restricts users to only the resources necessary for their roles. this limits the potential damage a compromised account or a malicious insider could cause. reduced reliance on vpns with ztna theres less dependency on traditional vpns which are complex to manage particularly at scale. this also improves user experience and reduces the performance bottlenecks commonly associated with vpns. enhanced user experience ztna provides faster more direct access to applications than traditional vpnbased access reducing latency and improving productivity for remote and mobile users. with continuous authentication and adaptive security users enjoy a balance of security and convenience as they only need to reauthenticate when risk levels change. the evolution of ztna zero trust network continues to evolve to address the growing complexities of modern cyberthreats and remote work environments. initially ztna introduced the core principles of zero trust by providing access based on user identity and device posture rather than traditional network perimeter defenses. however as cyberthreats have evolved so has the need for a more comprehensive and adaptive approach leading to the development of advancements in ztna including granular application access control. ztna now provides more detailed access control at the application level moving beyond simple network or ipbased access. it ensures that users have access only to the specific applications and resources they need and within those applications limits them to the specific data and operations theyre authorized to perform. continuous trust assessment. traditional ztna generally relied on a onetime trust assessment at the start of a session. ztna now adopts a continuous trust model evaluating user and device behavior dynamically throughout the session. continuous monitoring helps detect and respond to anomalies or risky behavior in realtime. integrated threat prevention. ztna now integrates threat prevention capabilities such as malware detection intrusion prevention and other security checks directly into the access model. this proactive security layer helps prevent attackers from moving laterally within a network even if they gain initial access. enhanced user and device context awareness. ztna now goes beyond just verifying user identity and device posture incorporating more contextual factors such as user behavior patterns device history and environmental factors like geolocation and time of access. this helps create a more precise risk profile for each access request. ztna with secure access service edge secure access service edge sase is a cybersecurity framework

https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-zero-trust-network-access,zero trust network access ztna  benefits  overview  zscaler,zero trust network access ztna is a set of technologies that enable secure remote access to internal applications. trust is never granted implicitly and access is granted on a needtoknow leastprivileged basis defined by granular policies. ztna gives users secure connectivity to private apps without placing them on the network or exposing apps to the internet. the future of work is distributed and remote workforces and cloud workloads demand secure remote access. however traditional remote access solutions like virtual private networks vpns are not flexible or granular enough for distributed environments increasing breach risks. this is a key reason 65 of enterprises recently reported plans to replace their vpns with a solution such as ztna. ztna provides secure remote access to internal applications for any user from anywhere without putting critical resources at risk. to accomplish this it starts with an architecture thats fundamentally different from a networkcentric solution. relying on a softwaredefined perimeter sdp  ztna enforces secure identitybased access controls. this helps organizations replace their vpns while reducing dependence on tools like ddos protection global load balancing and firewalls. vpns give users access to a network and its resources through an encrypted private tunnel. for many years they were sufficient for users who worked remotely on occasion. however cloud and remote work trends in the midtolate 2010s began to highlight shortcomings in the vpn approach. ztna provides secure leastprivileged access. instead of granting trust based only on credentials it verifies users based on a breadth of context including device location and identity for every access request. once verified users receive direct application access rather than networkwide access. with vpns creating serious compliance and security risks more and more organizations are discovering the advantages of ztna. here are some of the top reasons to make the switch ztna helps organizations strengthen their overall security posture and agility by delivering while ztna has many use cases most organizations start with one of these four. vpns are inconvenient and slow for users difficult to manage and offer poor security. more than half of organizations cite security and poor user experiences as the top challenges of vpn solutions. most thirdparty users receive overprivileged access and they largely use unmanaged devices both of which introduce risks. ztna significantly reduces thirdparty risk by never providing direct network access and enforcing leastprivileged access to apps. ma integrations can span multiple years as organizations converge networks and deal with overlapping ips. ztna can provide direct app access with no need to converge networks or resolve ip overlap significantly simplifying and speeding up ma value capture. securing hybrid and multicloud access is the most popular place for organizations to start their ztna journey. as more companies adopt the cloud the vast majority are turning to ztna for security and access control for their multicloud strategies. how does ztna simplify multicloud access ztna simplifies multicloud access by providing secure direct connections between users and specific apps wherever they are. it eliminates the need for complex networklevel configurations or redundant vpns using identitybased authentication and granular access controls to unify security across clouds. implementing ztna follows a phased approach designed to ensure smooth adoption enhance security and reduce risks in todays crowded marketplace its important to consider several other key criteria when evaluating ztna solutions against your unique needs keep these things in mind as you look for the vendor that complements your goals and vision . zscaler private access is the worlds most deployed ztna platform built on the unique zscaler zero trust architecture. as a cloud native service zpa can be deployed in hours to replace legacy vpns and remote access tools with a holistic zero trust platform. ztna is more secure than vpns because it gives access only to specific apps instead of entire networks. this reduces risks like lateral movement hiding sensitive systems from attackers and shrinking the attack surface for better protection. industries like healthcare finance and tech may gain the most from ztna. however for any organization that depends on remote teams strict rules or large networks ztna helps them keep data and apps safe with leastprivileged access. ztna is simple to set up and oversee. it works with cloudbased systems so it deploys in days not weeks. its portals offer quick control of policies instant user insights and easy scaling for growth. can ztna improve cybersecurity in hybrid work environments ztna boosts security for hybrid work by limiting access to apps stopping lateral movement and changing policies based on device and location. it guards systems without slowing down or complicating user access. is ztna a good alternative to legacy network segmentation ztna is ideal for replacing network segmentation. it uses identitybased app permissions instead of complex network setups removing overaccess risks while simplifying security for workflows and cloud setups.,796

use emailtofax with your preferred email account. a paid service faxburner has a free plan which users can sign up to and use without ever paying a penny or even providing any payment details. the free plan with faxburner lets users send and receive faxes  however there are a few big limitations to each. for sending faxes you can only send 5 fax pages in total before youll have to upgrade  it does not reset each month. for receiving faxes you can receive up to 25 pages per month forever for free. however you cannot keep your own fax number. whenever you expect to receive faxes you can receive a temporary fax number from faxburner  this number will be yours to receive faxes on for 24 hours and then you will have to receive a new and different temporary fax number. faxburner is not advised as a way of sending and receiving confidential or sensitive faxes  it is not hipaa compliant even under its highest paid plan and very little detail is provided about the security faxburner does offer it doesnt even claim to encrypt transmissions which would make it less secure than the average online faxing service. faxburner has a very positive score on the apple store with a 4.95 rating . they also frequently respond to good and bad reviews in a unique and engaging way  we even found one bad review which led them to refund a customers annual charge because they locked themselves out of their account. people are generally very satisfied with using faxburner as a lowcost or free online fax option. if youll never need to send many faxes but want a quick and easy way

sending you any spam or junk mail and keep secure servers and claim to delete your fax data 3 days after you send your fax. faxzero is wellliked by the tech industry as a basic free fax provider with techradar giving it 4stars and pcmag giving it 3stars  the latter saying if you refuse to pay for a fax its the best option. faxzero is a good alternative to gotfreefax standing out for offering more free faxes and for encouraging people to participate in politics. however we wouldnt recommend it above gotfreefax as an allround fax service due to the fax quality branding the inability to receive faxes and some other factors. that said its very useful as a free fax service if you need to quickly fire off a fax to a friend read our faxzero review here. fax.plus is an online faxing service from

https://copyblogger.com/content-marketing/,the complete content marketing guide for 2025  copyblogger,content marketing is an excellent strategy to make potential customers aware of your brand. the content in content marketing could be a video blog post podcast or social media post. as most potential customers often do some preliminary research before purchasing products or services theyll likely find your content before making a purchase decision. if your content is helpful those potential customers are more likely to trust your brand and buy your products or services when theyre ready to make a purchase. the problem is that not all content marketing strategies are equally effective. you need to know what problems your potential customers are searching what makes a piece of content convert which content platforms theyre using and how to work with platform algorithms to get in front of your potential customers. to help you implement an effective content marketing strategy heres a complete content marketing guide for 2024. our academy only costs one dollar to join for your first month. that means you can give it a try and learn a ton with zero risk. it was already the best place on the internet to learn content copywriting and online sales. now its extremely affordable to get in. well make it 300 eventually so get in at a dollar while you still can. content marketing is a form of inbound marketing that attracts users to your brand by providing useful or entertaining content  usually in the form of text video or audio. content marketing is valuable to companies because it helps them build relationships and trust with their potential customers and existing customers at scale. as a result its easier to sell your products faster. the roi of content is notoriously difficult to measure as its often just one step in the customer journey but brands with strong content marketing strategies tend to have lower customer acquisition costs and generate compounding returns. content marketing also has a snowball effect as those who use content marketing to build an audience see higher returns for each additional piece of content they publish. effective content marketing attracts people to your brand. you might publish a video podcast episode or blog post and then people interested in the topic consume it and become acquainted with your brand voice . once you have that persons attention you can build a trusting relationship with them. as a result you can sell them products and services. if youre looking for content marketing and seo services  check out copybloggers agency digital commerce partners . we specialize in delivering targeted organic traffic for profitable businesses. companies with excellent content marketing strategies have an unfair advantage over their competitors for several reasons. below well discuss just a few of them. quality content creation isnt cheap but youll see a stronger roi from each piece of content you produce because your audience will grow. the first video blog post or social media post you publish might only be seen by a few people but as more and more people find your content and become followers each sequential piece of content you publish will be seen by more people and produce a stronger roi. so unlike paid ads where you and your competitors can earn roughly the same roi for each dollar spent brands with strong content marketing strategies and a large audience can earn significantly more for each piece of content published. another benefit of content marketing is that you can filter the type of customers you attract based on the content you produce. for example if your target audience is exclusively cmos you can discuss only topics that a cmo would be interested in like hiring great talent. you might also offer access to exclusive reports on industry benchmarks that would interest a cmo. in contrast paid ads force you to rely on the platforms to accurately identify your target audience. with privacy concerns on the rise and less accurate audience targeting these platforms are producing lower returns. content marketing has a flywheel effect and produces higher returns over time  especially if you produce evergreen content. with evergreen content content that is relevant for years you can continue to generate returns from it even years after it was published. so even if you stop producing content for a period of time youll still likely have a steady pipeline of leads thanks to your evergreen content. content marketing is essentially a cheat code to build trust with your potential customers at scale. the more they become familiar with your brands viewpoints and identity the easier it is to trust your brand and the more likely they are to continue purchasing from your brand. content marketing can be any type of media across a variety of platforms though the most common forms of content marketing include below well discuss each of these types of content in detail and when you should use them. blog posts are the bread and butter of the content marketing strategy for most b2b and even many b2c companies and local businesses. blogging is valuable because it can help you rank in search engines for keywords that your ideal customers may search. for example if you sell cro software ranking first in google for the term best cro software will help you drive valuable leads because those searchers are clearly looking to purchase a product like yours. the process of optimizing blog posts to rank at the top of google is called seo search engine optimization . while blog posts are excellent at generating organic traffic to your website effective marketers know that they need to also provide a next step to move the visitor through the buyer journey and eventually convert them into a customer. check out our guide to simple seo and content marketing. therefore savvy content marketers often include a call to action in the blog posts to download a lead magnet like a white paper or research study in exchange for their email address. once you have a website visitors email address you can retarget them with other valuable content to move them through your marketing funnel. another major benefit of longform content like blog posts is that they often produce compounding results assuming the content is evergreen or updated every few years. social media content is excellent for generating brand awareness and many brands particularly those in the b2c space rely heavily on social media for audience building. social media marketing is also becoming increasingly popular among b2b brands as more and more people turn to individual thought leaders for professional advice and industry news. linkedins revenue alone is an excellent reflection of the rise of b2b social media as the platform grew 26.2 in 2022 to 14.5 billion  the highest percentage of growth it has seen in the past three years. the benefit of social media marketing is that you can develop relationships with your audience much more quickly as its a very personal form of content marketing. the downside is that social media content isnt evergreen and the key to winning with social media marketing often comes down to publishing a high volume of highquality content. this can be tricky as its important to publish highquality content readers want to consume. video content is also becoming increasingly common in b2b and b2c content marketing strategies as its now easier than ever to record a highquality video on even a simple iphone. its also easier to quickly build a relationship with your audience if they can see and hear you which is likely because body language makes it easier to trust a person. video content is also excellent for content repurposing as you can turn a single video into podcast episodes social media clips emails or blog posts. the downside with video content is that the best video content usually features a person so it might not be a great option if there isnt anyone within the company who enjoys being on camera. in addition the person on camera will likely become the face of the brand. if that person later leaves the company the audience might leave as well. there are more podcast listeners and podcasters than ever before. but even with the competition starting a podcast is an effective way to grow your audience . when people hear your voice and stories repeatedly its easy to quickly build a deeply loyal following. podcasts also have very high retention as unlike other forms of content marketing the audience can passively consume your content. so unlike videos or blog posts that require the listeners undivided attention they might multitask while listening to your podcast. your podcast will also likely become part of that persons routine which makes the audience even stickier. for example they might always listen to your podcast while driving to work or working out at the gym. like video content the downside of podcast content is that youll likely lose your audience if the podcast host decides to leave your company. email marketing is arguably one of the best content formats because its the only platform you own entirely. email marketing is also an essential part of ecommerce performance marketing . for example a social media platform might change its algorithm causing you to lose access to your audience or a google algorithm update could cause your blog content to drop in the search results and youll lose organic traffic. however after someone gives you their email address you own that list and can retarget them until they unsubscribe because you arent at the mercy of a platform. another benefit of email marketing is that the people on your email list have demonstrated interest in your company by giving you their email addresses making them higherquality prospects. many content marketing efforts fail because they lack a solid content marketing strategy to attract the right prospects and nurture them through the buyer journey. if you randomly begin publishing content on different platforms without a thoughtful approach to which channels youll focus on how youll position your brand and how each piece of content moves the customer through the user journey youll likely be disappointed by the roi from your content marketing efforts. to solve these problems heres a stepbystep approach to creating a successful content marketing strategy . content marketing only works if you attract the right customer. otherwise youll have low conversion rates or convert customers who are a poor fit for your product or service creating unnecessary customer support headaches and high churn. to identify your ideal target customer ask yourself these questions once you answer those questions youll have a good sense of your ideal buyer persona and the rest of your content strategy will become clear. most customers dont make a purchase the first time they visit your website and thats okay. content marketing aims to build a relationship with prospects to eventually lead them to make a purchase. there are several stages of the content marketing funnel from awareness the customer is just learning about the pain point and potential solutions to the purchase decision phase the customer is solution aware and ready to purchase a product to solve the pain point. for example if your product automates accounting processes heres what the customer journey might look like creating content for each of these phases of the customers research process is important so that you can lead them through the funnel to ultimately purchase your product or service. if you pitch your product too soon you can lose trust. yet if you never pitch your product theyll never convert. youll also notice that this marketing funnel has multiple different content formats. so how do you choose the best content format for your marketing funnel some audiences gravitate more towards specific platforms than others. for example most people dont go to tiktok to hire a lawyer or marketing agency. however tiktok would be an excellent place to sell beauty products. the good news is that you can quickly identify the most effective platforms by analyzing your competitors platforms. even if you know that all of your competitors are producing video content dont try to create video content unless you know you can consistently publish highquality video content. the key to winning with content marketing is consistency so selecting a form of content you enjoy is important. now that you know what content youll produce you can map out the top middle and bottomoffunnel content. its also worth noting that you dont necessarily need a different form of content for each funnel stage. for example you can create tofu mofu and bofu content with just blog posts. the reason its important to map out your marketing funnel at this stage is to ensure you have a clear call to action at each step to move the visitor forward in the buyer journey. an effective content marketing plan is about more than just mapping out the types of content that it will take to produce. you have to actually have something unique and interesting to say to get people to pay attention to your content. so the next step is to figure out how to consistently generate content ideas that are unique and appealing to your ideal audience. we created an entire blog post on generating content ideas  but a simple framework you can use to consistently curate interesting content ideas is this with the rise of ai writers flooding social platforms with metoo content thought leadership content with a unique and contrarian viewpoint will continue to stand out and youll actually find it easier to build an audience. if you cant authentically say yes to both of those questions dont publish the content. if you consistently publish content with an authentic brand voice and dont regurgitate the same ideas that have already been published youll gain trust much more quickly as people will look to you as an industry leader. your content marketing strategy will only scale if you publish new content consistently. in fact the formula for a great content marketing strategy is pretty simple if you do these three things youll find that your content marketing strategy is highly effective. the problem is that most people give up too quickly or dont publish consistently. as a result the audience you build forgets about your content and youll have to restart the relationship from zero. the good news is that implementing a simple content calendar and workflow process can reduce inconsistencies. to get started adopt a project management platform like trello  basecamp  or asana  and then break down each content marketing campaign into various tasks that you can assign to your marketing team members with due dates. heres a great sample editorial calendar in trello once youve created a workflow process its pretty easy to then ensure each piece of content is published consistently. this is tricky as content marketing is a longterm play and you probably wont see any immediate returns on your investment. however some early content marketing metrics you can track to make sure your strategy is heading in the right direction include in addition to tracking these general brand kpis be sure to also track specific campaigns so that you can assess what content performed the best and double down on producing more of those content formats and ideas. most marketers track the majority of their content marketing efforts in google analytics though you can also use thirdparty tools like semrush or ahrefs to measure these metrics. the content marketing strategy established above is the process you need to get an effective content marketing program off the ground. once you have established systems and processes in place here are a few more advanced content marketing tips to consider. audience research is important but instead of just observing them from afar interact with potential customers to learn more about their pain points and build genuine relationships. you can do this by joining slack groups facebook groups and other online communities to learn about the pain points these people face. for example if you sell to airbnb hosts this might be a great community to join. while you shouldnt sell your products or services in these groups you can answer questions and use members questions as inspiration for new content ideas. while content marketing should educate potential customers it also does need to sell them at some point  otherwise it wont be a profitable marketing strategy. the good news is that there is a way to tastefully pitch your product or service. this blog post targets the keyword how to create an online course and the brand that published this blog post learnworlds is an online course platform. as you can see one of the steps is learning where to host your course. they first provide several options such as self hosting and online course marketplaces then they provide a third option which is using an online course platform like learnworlds. then they explain how it works and specific features that you should know about. for someone executing the steps of creating an online course this is helpful information and can drive conversions for the brand. the key to tastefully pitching your productservice is most businesses dont have the capacity to produce unique content for youtube social media the blog and a podcast. the good news is that you dont have to create unique content for each platform. content repurposing allows you to take one piece of content and rework it into different platforms. for example if you have a long form video you can take clips from it to post on social media and hire a writer to rework the video transcript into a blog post. this is a great example of content repurposing from the pilot institute. they published this video they also occasionally repurpose clips from their videos on instagram  this allows you to reach more people as each potential customer has their own platform preferences. the key is to make sure that each piece of content is formatted to the platform. for example hire a writer to rework the transcript into a blog post rather than just publishing it as a plain transcript. additionally you can see that the clips posted on instagram from the pilot institute are well optimized for the instagram platform as each one has subtitles and the clips themselves are cut well for social media with each scene only lasting a second or two. many content marketers are excellent at attracting their ideal audience though far fewer know how to keep them engaged and eventually convert those visitors into customers. unfortunately if your customers never convert your content marketing wont be effective. to solve this problem include a helpful resource like a cheat sheet or a template that the audience can download. then ask for their email address in exchange for the free download. once you have their email address you can send them a nurture email sequence to continue remarketing to them and eventually convert them into a customer. for example they have a guide on conversion rate optimization and then offer a cta to download a cro planning kit when you click on download the free planner they ask for your email address. once they have your email they can remarket to you through email and eventually convert you into a customer. we already mentioned that analyzing your competitors content marketing strategies is a great way to get a basic understanding of what types of content and topics resonate with your audience. however a pro content marketing tip is to analyze your competitors ads and use them as inspiration for your organic content marketing strategy. specifically look at your competitors longest running ads as those are probably generating the most sales otherwise they would have stopped running them. to track your competitors ads you can use a paid tool like ahrefs and look at the keywords theyre paying to rank for. these are all excellent keywords to write seo content for you can also look at the meta ads library to analyze your competitors ads. it also tells you how long the ad has been running for so take note of the ones that have been running the longest. linkedin also has an ads library you can use to track your competitors ads for the first time were bringing the

submit their own content recorded on a gopro to win a new gopro. this kind of content performs incredibly well because rather than just sharing a branded post contestants share their best social media content with the gopro hashtag. as the content itself is already the creators very best work it naturally earns tons of engagement which multiplies the reach of the gopro hashtag. while gopro has an advantage as their audience is mostly creators any brand can use the contest blueprint. instead of asking contestants to share a branded post ask them to create their own content. b2b brands are beginning to realize that the best way to win on social media is to boost the executives presence. justin welsh is an excellent example of a b2b influencer who has amassed a substantial following by consistently publishing high quality content on twitter and linkedin. in fact he now has an entire course on his process and the heart of his strategy is even if youre a member of the marketing team and trying to discover methods to level up the companys brand awareness building your own social media presence or the social media presence of executives is a great way to then communicate the brands messages to a loyal audience. most b2b brands assume that creating a video content marketing strategy means you must produce youtube video content. however ocho is an excellent example of a brand that creates full video courses for its customers. they also collaborate with other industry influencers to create adjacent courses. for example they collaborated with angel investors tax strategists and other experts who then helped them promote the content. this is an interesting youtube channel that covers everything you could possibly want to know about disney. unlike most consumer youtube channels that show off the creators personal life the host aj never even shows her face on the channel and instead provides detailed descriptions of her experiences at various disney restaurants theme parks and hotels. she even has a team of people who go to various disney locations to try out different foods and rides and then report back to her to deliver authoritative content for the youtube channel. its an outstanding collection of truly expert insider tips that you cant find elsewhere and its packaged in wellorganized videos theres usually a list of tips or rankings for each topic covered that she narrates. this is also a very scalable business model as she doesnt have to personally show her face or test out the various theme park amenities herself. my first million is a b2b podcast hosted by sam parr and shaan puri both of whom have successfully built and sold multimillion dollar companies. however the podcast is popular not just because theyre successful entrepreneurs but because they deliver unique perspectives through entertaining stories that most people have never heard of before. with over 100000 listeners its one of the top business podcasts but its actually owned by the hubspot podcast network. so even if youre a b2b brand you can elevate some of your executives to start a podcast and then use the ad space to promote your own company. this is a popular consumer podcast about relationships and dating that has succeeded largely thanks to the hosts entertaining stories about their personal experiences. they also have interesting guests on the podcast though its their raw authentic stories that seem to keep the audience hooked. so if you have a podcast and are talking to a consumer audience the best way to build trust and remain entertaining is sharing your own personal stories and being vulnerable about past experiences and challenges. the danny miranda show is only a few years old though danny has interviewed some of the biggest content creators podcasters on the scene including gary vaynerchuck alex hormozi and others. he also recently sat down with the team at copyblogger to discuss how to grow a successful podcast . while video and audio content is on the rise text based content is still very popular and is still critical for blog writing email marketing and even a lot of social media content. so while there is a difference between copywriting and content marketing  many copywriters are content marketers and its a valuable skill to acquire. therefore learning how to be a copywriter is one of the fastest and most effective ways to improve the results of your content marketing. its the difference between a reader getting bored or frantically sharing your content with everyone they know. theres no way ill be able to cover everything you need to know about copywriting in this blog post. its simply too broad and deep of a topic. however i can share some of the essential elements of good copy that you can use to start improving your content right away. good copywriters know that headline writing is important. its the one thing that determines whether or not your content gets read. you could have the most incredible content in the world but if your headline is boring or weak it wont matter. a good headline is clear specific and intriguing. it should both tell the reader what to expect while also teasing them about whats inside. your headline should also qualify your reader meaning that it should attract your target audience. if its too vague a reader will start reading  thinking that the article applies to them  only to discover it has nothing to do with them. theyll feel tricked. this is critical. you arent just trying to get anyone and everyone to click to read your article. that becomes meaningless. you want the right person reading your article someone who you know will get value from it. so spend the extra minutes hours even days getting your headline right. copywriting is all about understanding the emotional and psychological state of the reader. you have to be able to get inside their heads and join the conversation. one way to do this is to write to someone very specific. this could be an avatar of your ideal customer that youve created or it could be a real person who fits the bill of your target audience. either way picture this person as you write. what do they struggle with what are there experiences how would you talk to them if you were sitting on the couch at a coffee shop together once youre clear on that write to them. ignore all of your professionalism and grammar rules. just write like youre there at the coffee shop with them or like youre writing an email to them. your writing will become more personal and youll form stronger connections with your readers which is key to building a loyal audience . they will feel like youre talking right to them because you are to some extent. thats the kind of writing your audience will read share and buy from. one of the cardinal sins of copywriting is too much complexity that makes your message confusing. good copy is all about breaking things down so that your reader can easily and quickly understand what youre talking about. this means not using complicated words insider speak technical jargon and long perfectly structured sentences. instead break up your sentences. state your point simply. find the easiest simplest way to say what youre trying to say. otherwise your reader will have to work hard to sift through what youre writing and get confused. as a result they dont do anything. they dont read they dont share they dont buy nothing. thats not what you want. so keep your writing simple and tothepoint. hopefully you can see the value of content marketing but if you want some additional proof that its one of the most effective long term marketing strategies here are some statistics. yes content marketing is effective as about 62 of b2b buyers will read at least 37 pieces of content before theyll agree to talk to a salesperson making content marketing essential for your marketing funnel. about 73 of b2b marketers and 70 of b2c marketers incorporate content marketing into their overall digital marketing strategies. content marketing costs range but about 39 of companies spend between 1000 and 5000 per month on content marketing 33 spend over 5000 per month on content marketing and about 27 spend less than 1000 per month on content marketing. in addition most companies 69 increased their content marketing budgets in 2023 while only 3 planned to decrease spend. according to data from statista the most popular social media platform is facebook with over 2.9 billion monthly active users . youtube is the second most popular social media platform with over 2.5 billion monthly active users . surveys show that about 93 of marketers worldwide use social media marketing in their businesss marketing strategy. according to statistics from semrush  the most popular form of content promotion is publishing organic social media content 73. heres a full breakdown of the most popular content promotion strategies studies show that 91 of companies use video marketing in their marketing strategies which is the highest its ever been yes about 77 of internet users still actively read blog content. statistics show that 61.4 of marketers have used ai in at least one of their marketing campaigns and 44.4 have used ai to aid their content creation process. for those who are not yet using ai a lack of understanding of ai 41.9 was cited as the top reason for not incorporating it into their workflow. paid costs continue to rise and as targeting becomes less accurate due to privacy concerns the roi of paid ads will likely continue to decline. therefore its likely that more and more companies will invest in content marketing. in addition the introduction of artificial intelligence from ai content writing tools to ai video editing tools has made it easier than ever before for any company to increase its content output. as the volume of content increases b2b and b2c content consumers gravitate more toward content that reflects personal experiences and unique and original ideas. therefore its likely that individual content creators will be critical to any brands content marketing strategy over the next several years. if you want to be one of the creators at the forefront of content marketing consider joining the copyblogger academy .,5428

marketing plan ensures that every piece of content has a purpose and that every purpose aligns with a greater organizational goal. read how to create a content marketing strategy in 11 steps to start building your plan. topnotch content requires a worldclass team so focus on building a flexible resilient content marketing team. find folks with a wide variety of specialties dont be afraid to find freelancers and contractors to supplement your content needs. they can be great at filling skill gaps or keeping up with fluctuating demand. from the getgonot lateryou need to decide what business goals will be crucial to your team. you cant do everything so get hyperfocused on a handful of metrics you want to tackle ensure your content aligns with your marketing goalsnot the other way around. for example content teams often make the mistake of coming up with good ideas before creating goals. this leads to amazing content that nobody wants or results your business doesnt need or care about. before you start thinking of new content you want to create take a look at your existing library. youll likely find heaps of great articles videos and graphics that just need a bit of tender loving care to perform well. for example you might find a 3000word blog post getting littletono traffic. identify keywords it might rank for on page 2 or 3 of googles search engine results pages serps and optimize it to try and rank for page 1. itll take you 10 of the time of creating a new pieceand itll start ranking faster too. while auditing your existing content library look for gaps. what potential topics have you not covered yet do competitors create content you dont have understanding your content gaps gives you an excellent place to start when researching new pieces. for example do you lack howto tutorials for your products do you need a starter video for the onboarding process you can likely repurpose every piece of content you create. whether an article video or podcast there are dozens of ways you can repurpose your content in different formats. lets take a podcast for example. here are a few ways you could repurpose a podcast episode need more ways to repurpose content weve got 20 of them. check out 20 simple ways to repurpose content to boost your traffic . every piece of content you create can be multipurpose. for example you might create a productfocused blog post about a new feature youre releasing. thats fineyour current audience will love that. however youll likely need to optimize this piece for search engines if you ever want anyone outside your existing customers to learn about it. get comfortable doing basic keyword research and finding your users search queries. basic seo best practices can take your content the extra mile. sometimes content teams get stuck in a rut of producing the same content whether blog posts guides or social media campaigns. think outside the box and branch out. theres a whole wide world of content opportunities experiment every once in a while to see if something clicks. heres a quick list of different content formats you could produce your sites backlinks and domain authority will impact how well it ranks on serps. fortunately content creation and backlink building go hand in hand. look for ways to use content to create highquality backlinks. here are a few contentcreation strategies for building backlinks when you find something that works scale it. for example if you have a handful of articles that outperform all the rest which is often the case decipher any similarities and what makes them perform well. do the articles follow a certain format does the writing center on specific topics once you find the keys to success turn them into a replicable template . for example you might discover listicles perform best on your website or find topoffunnel what is content works best. scale your successes and juice them for all you can. a content calendar or even an editorial calendar will keep your content production and publishing schedule on track. managing handfuls of writers and projects simultaneously can get messyespecially if you dont use a task management system. without a content calendar youll end up with some weeks where you publish an overwhelming amount of content and others that experience content droughts. you want consistency. a content calendar ensures every new piece of content gets the time and space it deserves. that means you might publish 1 piece every day or 2 a week. use a content calendar to stick to whatever cadence you decide on. you want the content you create to solve problems. think about questions your customers might have or issues your products help solve. once you identify the pain point solve it with content. your solution might not always be the primary answer and thats ok. for example if you sell fitness equipment you might create motivational content to inspire your community to work out. or if you sell email services you might create content marketing best practice articles to help your customers understand how email works together with content marketing. see what i did there content teams get pressured to create create create. with a neverending todo list getting pulled into the publish publish publish mindset is easy. however its vital to take a step back every once in a while and ask questions like these will help you discover if your content is valuable or just busy work. frequency isnt so much about quality over quantity though well get into that soon. its more about how often you publish on different channels. more even if its quality isnt always better. for example your customers might love your monthly email newsletter but that doesnt mean theyd love it more as a weekly newsletter. the same goes with any medium. just because you can publish a youtube video every day doesnt mean you should. your audience leads busy lives. they have work family and personal ambitions to go after. keep that in mind when you produce content. dont overwhelm your customers to the point where they cant consume all your content even if they want to. believe it or not not everyone wants to consume your content. shocking right yet they wont always get to choose especially when you use traditional media video advertisements or payperclick ads to get in front of them. however on channels they do get to choose ensure you get permission before marketing to them. for example email and sms are optin marketing channels. just because you have your customers email address from a purchase order or delivery update request doesnt mean you have permission to send them marketing messages. they need to give you  unambiguous consent . follow these optin options to learn more about getting subscribers the right way. also brush up on general data protection regulation gdpr laws to ensure your email program is compliant. content marketing is an everchanging field. trends come and go algorithms change and new channels flare up and perish months later. its up to you to stay on top of things to capitalize on shifts. i remember when i started listening to podcasts about 8 years ago. even then i thought i had already missed the podcast bandwagonand look where we are now. even if it doesnt go according to plan dont be afraid to try a new tactic and channelits a learning experience. plus its a solid excuse to secure your brands name and tag on possible digital channels. you might think a channel might not align with your brand but youd be surprised. just about any company can find success on platforms ranging from instagram to tiktok to reddit. theres a good chance your audience uses these different platforms and that means theres an opportunity for you to reach them there. the challenge comes from creating relevant content for each channel that your audience wants . thats no small feat and definitely beyond the scope of this article. here are a few channels to consider experimenting with if you havent already good content doesnt get the love it deserves if the user experience ux suffers. everything from your sites user interface ui to the pages color scheme to accessibility concerns can impact the user experience and its a shame when these elements destroy quality content. work with your uiux team to improve these factors on your website. test how different layouts affect bounce rates and completion rates. then keep working to improve your contents experience to increase the likelihood that customers consume enjoy and share it. i told you wed get here eventually. when it comes to content quality is always better than quantity. often you dont need 5 small blog postsyou just need one big comprehensive one. the same is true for almost all content you produce. dont worry about how much of it you createinstead measure each pieces impact. push back against management if they set content creation goals. content creation isnt your end goalits results. and who cares if you drive results with 3 videos or 15 videos while its cool to jump on new trends never forget about evergreen content. evergreen content is always relevant. it might not get increased attention or features in headlines but its something your audience will always want. lets look at email for example. right now everyone cares about artificial intelligence ai assisting with email creation. thats fine and relevant but do you know what email marketers will always search for interest in topics like aibased email marketing and brand indicators for message identification bimi will rise and fall but evergreen topics will always be important to your community. you can stretch the life of every piece of content you produce by looking for ways to combine it with other content types. for example you might mix and match your content by adding a video to a blog post or using a new ebook in a webinar presentation. its always best not to make claims unless you can back them up with data. for example i cant just say email marketing is the best distribution channel without also including a statistic like email marketing produces a high return on investment with a 38 return on every dollar spent . look for any claims you make in your writing and find data to support them. dig deep down the research rabbit hole to ensure its an accurate legit statistic and not a regurgitated hoax without any original research. ideally before you create it connect every piece of content to a specific business goal. will this content drive traffic or help build leads do we want this content to build brand awareness or drive sales if you cant find a business goal to support your desired content put it in the backlog. you might find a purpose for that content idea later but stick with content creation that supports your immediate kpis and metrics. ai writers and graphic generators are emerging. these tools can help create original content build outlines answer questions and write articles. however these are still in the infancy stage and you should avoid overrelying on them. dont be afraid to use aijust dont abuse it. let it inspire and give you ideas but dont think it can replace your content marketing team. it cant. need ideas for using ai try these aibased email marketing use cases . its easy for your content marketing team to become a silo. with so much going on and neverending demand for content collaboration often gets pushed aside. think of teams you could partner with to bolster your effective content marketing efforts. for example you might work with product marketing or sales to identify content to support their needs or get help from your developers to write more technicalfocused content. old content can start to pile up. while often a vanity metric lots of underperforming outdated content just takes up space and accumulates cobwebs. if you cant revive optimize or repurpose a piece its time to get rid of it. itll be hard. you might tear up a bit and thats ok. if you cant do it yourself work with a partner who can identify content pieces that need to go objectively. you can do this. we believe in you. when you publish new content give it the promotional love it deserves. just because you post something doesnt mean your audience will read or watch itthey likely wont know it exists. use the following promotional channels to distribute every piece of content you produce better around 1.3 billion people live with some visual impairmentthat could be a massive part of your audience. and even if its not creating accessible content is just the right thing to do. think about accessibility design best practices  and ensure you add the small touches that make your content widely consumable. for example add descriptive alt text to your images and consider providing american sign language asl interpretation online when hosting virtual events . hey alexa how do i optimize my content for voice search voice search isnt just coming...its already here and its changing how people find your content. with smart speakers in millions of homes and voice assistants built into virtually every smartphone optimizing for voice search isnt negotiable anymore. voice searches are fundamentally different from typed queries. theyre conversational questionbased and typically longer. when someone types they might search best email marketing platform. but when they speak it becomes whats the best email marketing platform for small businesses heres how to make your content voicesearch friendly gone are the days when content was just a oneway street. static content boring. todays audience doesnt want to just read your stuff. they want to play with it manipulate it and make it their own. interactive content flatout performs better. quizzes calculators polls and interactive infographics dont just capture attention they hold it hostage in the best possible way of course. think about it which would you rather consume a 2000word article about email deliverability rates or an interactive tool that analyzes your specific sending patterns and gives you personalized recommendations create calulators add quizzes ask for feedback enable comments incorporate sliders and toggles. this is where you go all in on whozits whatzsits and thingamabobs. your blog has some deadweight. it doesnt take an seo expert or outside consultant to see that. dont panic though. youre not alone. we all get to that point sometimes and its okay. well as long as you do something about it that is. for example weve deleted archived and redirected hundreds of blog posts over the last year or so and we plan to do a lot more. yes the vanity metric of number of posts surely takes a hit but you know what doesnt our traffic. now you know those posts the ones gathering digital dust in the corners of your site bringing down your averages and making google question your content quality. its time for some tough love. by removing underperforming content youre actually helping your best stuff rank higher. think of it like thinning out seedlings to let the strongest plants thrive. the 8020 rule applies perfectly here roughly 20 of your content likely drives 80 of your traffic. the rest its just taking up space and diluting your sites authority. ouch but true. we get it. getting over your emotional attachment to content you worked hard to create. that post from 2019 about email trends might have been your baby but if its getting two visits a month and contains outdated advice its time to let it go. your content strategy has a serious middlechild syndrome. let me guess tons of topoffunnel awareness pieces a decent chunk of bottomfunnel conversion content but that middle section crickets. youre not alone. most content marketers are addicted to vanity metrics like page views hello topoffunnel or obsessed with conversion rates bottomfunnel leaving the critical consideration stage abandoned like a shopping cart on a discount website. your audience isnt ready to buy after reading one what is blog post and that case study isnt going to magically appear in front of someone who doesnt know they have a problem. the content journey is real folks. unfortunately heres where most companies mess up they create these pieces in isolation with no clear path from one stage to the next. you need deliberate content pathways that guide readers logically through the buyers journey. think of it like a netflix serieseach episode should leave viewers wanting the next one. your awareness piece should naturally lead to consideration content which should make the case for conversion content. youre either using ai tools for content creation or youre falling behind. theres no middle ground anymore. the initial response to ai was predictable but it cant match human creativity true...and also completely missing the point. ai isnt meant to replace your creative processits meant to accelerate it handle the grunt work and let your team focus on what humans do best strategic thinking and emotional connection. the key is finding the right humanai balance. the best content teams use ai as a superpower not a replacement. they feed the ai their brand voice guidelines provide specific prompts with context and then edit the output with their human expertise. the quality gap between ai early adopters and laggards is widening faster than most marketing leaders realize. yes there are ethical considerations. yes you should disclose ai usage when appropriate. and yes you should have clear guidelines about factchecking and quality control. but sitting on the sidelines isnt an option anymore. remember when your content operation was just you and a wordpress login those were simpler times. now youve likely got freelancers agencies subject matter experts and that intern who keeps publishing things without approval. content chaos isnt just annoyingits expensive. without proper governance youre practically begging for inconsistent messaging compliance nightmares and the inevitable who approved that moment during the executive review. think of content governance as the guardrails that keep your content machine from driving off a cliff. its not about bureaucracy. its about creating systems that scale without sacrificing quality. heres what a solid content governance framework looks like not everyone has time for your 3000word epic guides. there i said it. speaking of which this post is getting kind of long isnt it huh. were living in the tiktok era where attention spans are measured in seconds not minutes. and while theres absolutely still a place for comprehensive content ignoring microcontent is like ignoring that half your audience is scrolling on their phones during meetings. microcontent isnt just short contentits strategically bitesized pieces designed for immediate consumption and high shareability. think of it as content snacking between the full meals of your longer pieces. it fits perfectly into the gaps of your audiences daythe elevator ride the coffee line the three minutes before a meeting starts. when someone doesnt have time for your 45minute webinar they might still have time for your 60second tip video. plus microcontent is content marketing on easy mode. that statistic that took you hours to research turn it into a shareable graphic. that key insight buried on page 12 of your whitepaper make it a standalone social post. your customers are creating content about your brand whether you like it or not. the question is are you going to leverage it or ignore it usergenerated content isnt just free materialits authentic social proof that outperforms your polished marketing copy every single time. when nielsen reports that 92 of consumers trust peer recommendations over advertising theyre basically telling you to stop talking and let your customers do it for you. the smartest brands dont just collect ugc they actively shape it by providing creative frameworks. starbucks white cup contest didnt just ask for random photos. it gave clear parameters that resulted in onbrand artistic expressions. ugc creates a virtuous cycle. when customers see you featuring their peers theyre more likely to contribute their own content creating a sustainable ecosystem of authentic marketing material. that universally appealing content youre so proud of its probably alienating half your global audience. true content localization goes way beyond running your blog posts through google translate and calling it a day. its about recognizing that different markets have fundamentally different needs references pain points and cultural contexts. when your american case study references baseball metaphors and super bowl ads youre losing your international audience faster than you can say cultural imperialism and thats a mouthful already. localization isnt just for enterprise companies. even if youre a small business your digital content reaches global audiences. google analytics probably shows international traffic youre not effectively serving. start small if needed. identify your top international markets and localize your highestperforming content first. then expand as you see results. just please for the love of global commerce stop assuming everyone gets your references to american as apple pie or understands your payment processor that only works with us banks. by the time a keyword shows decent volume in ahrefs or semrush youre already too late to the party. the competition has arrived the difficulty has spiked and youre fighting an uphill battle for rankings. elite content marketers dont chase keywordsthey predict them. they identify emerging topics before they hit the research tools and establish authority while everyone else is still wondering if theres an opportunity. the content teams that master this approach build massive authority while competitors are still waiting for sufficient search volume to justify creating content. by the time everyone else jumps on the trend youre already ranking 1 with established backlinks and engagement signals. take conversational commerce as an example. brands that created definitive content when it was just a concept mentioned at tech conferences dominated the serp by the time it became a highvolume search term. this approach requires confidence and strategic risktaking. youll occasionally invest in topics that never take off. but when youre right which you will be if youre truly

https://www.akkio.com/beginners-guide-to-machine-learning,the complete beginners guide to machine learning,machine learning is a branch of computer science that allows computers to automatically infer patterns from data without being explicitly told what these patterns are. these inferences are often based on using algorithms to automatically examine the statistical properties of the data and creating mathematical models to represent the relationship between different quantities. lets contrast this with traditional computing which relies on deterministic systems wherein we explicitly tell the computer a set of rules to perform a specific task. this method of programming computers is referred to as being rulesbased. where machine learning differs from and supersedes rulesbased programming is that its capable of inferring these rules on its own. say youre a bank manager and youd like to figure out whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. in a rulesbased approach the bank manager or other experts would explicitly tell the computer that if the applicants credit score is less than a threshold reject the application. a machine learning algorithm however would simply take in historical data on the credit scores of customers and their loan outcomes and figure out on its own  what this threshold should be. in doing so the machine is learning from historical data and creating its own rules . this is just an introduction to machine learning of course as realworld machine learning models are generally far more complex than a simple threshold. still its a great example of just how powerful machine learning can be. any organizational kpi can be optimized as long as you have the relevant data. given a historical customer dataset for example you could predict which of your current customers are in danger of leaving so you can stop churn before it happens. modern approaches to machine learning have made great strides and can accomplish a lot more than just that. from selfdriving cars to voice recognition to the automated email filtering systems that flag the spam in your inbox machine learning algorithms form the basis of many of the advances in technology that weve come to depend on today. next lets consider the different types of machine learning algorithms and the specific types of problems they can solve. machine learning algorithms are often divided into three general categories though other classification schemes are also used supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. supervised machine learning refers to classes of algorithms where the machine learning model is given a set of data with explicit labels for the quantity were interested in this quantity is often referred to as the response or target. semisupervised learning uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to train ai models. if youre dealing with unlabeled data youll need to do data labeling. labeling is the process of annotating examples to help the training of a machine learning model. labeling is typically performed by humans which can be expensive and timeconsuming. however there are ways to automate the labeling process. a great example of supervised learning is the loan applications scenario we considered earlier. here we had historical data about past loan applicants credit scores and potentially income levels age etc. alongside explicit labels which told us if the person in question defaulted on their loan or not. supervised learning algorithms can be further subdivided into regression and classification . this difference refers to the type of quantity our target is. if the target is a choice between a few discrete categories  for example will the applicant default or not is this a picture of a cat a dog or a human etc.  then the problem is referred to as classification  as were trying to determine the class that a given data point belongs to. if however our target variable is continuous then the problem is referred to as regression . for example predicting the price of a house given the number of bedrooms and its location. in unsupervised learning problems the data were given has no labels and were simply looking for patterns. for example say youre amazon. given customers purchase history can we identify any clusters groups of similar customers in this scenario even though we dont have explicit definitive data on what a persons interests are just identifying that a particular group of customers purchase similar items can allow us to make purchase recommendations based on what other people in the cluster have also purchased. similar systems are what power amazons you might also be interested in carousel. kmeans clustering is a type of clustering model that takes the different groups of customers and assigns them to various clusters or groups based on similarities in their behavior patterns. on a technical level it works by finding the centroid for each cluster which is then used as the initial mean for the cluster. new customers are then assigned to clusters based on their similarity to other members of that cluster. additionally once weve identified the clusters we could then study their characteristics. for example suppose we see that a given cluster is buying many video games. in that case we can make an educated guess that this group of customers are gamers even though no one actually told us so. once weve done this form of analysis we could potentially even use the labels from unsupervised learning to create supervised learning models that may for example allow us to predict how much money a 25yearold gamer is likely to spend with us compared to a 50yearold fishing enthusiast. reinforcement learning is a class of machine learning algorithms where we assign a computer agent to perform some task without giving it much guidance on precisely what to do. instead the computer is allowed to make its own choices and depending on whether those choices lead to the outcome we want or not we assign penalties and rewards. we repeat this process multiple times allowing the computer to learn the optimal way of doing something by trial and error and repeated iterations. think of this as the carrotandstick approach to machine learning. its almost like the computer is playing a video game and discovering what works and what doesnt. interestingly playing games is precisely the application where reinforcement learning has shown the most astonishing results. googles infamous alphago model which trounced even the highestranked human players of go was built using reinforcement learning. google has since extended the same technology to alphazero a successor to the original alphago used as a reference by chess players to determine the best strategies. if youve seen machine learning in the news you almost certainly have also heard about deep learning. and you might be wondering at this point where deep learning fits into the above paradigm. deep learning is a subset of machine learning that breaks a problem down into several layers of neurons. these neurons are very loosely modeled on how neurons in the human brain work. this class of machine learning is referred to as deep learning because the typical artificial neural network the collection of all the layers of neurons often contains many layers. while deep learning was initially used for supervised learning problems recent advances have extended its capabilities to unsupervised and reinforcement learning problems. and they have shown tremendous results. many of the latest advances in computer vision which selfdriving cars and facial recognition systems depend on are rooted in the use of deep learning models. natural language processing which allows computers to understand natural human conversations and powers siri and google assistant also owes its success to deep learning. todays ai boom is largely thanks to the pioneers of deep learning geoffrey hinton yann lecun and yoshua bengio. these ai engineers were awarded the turing award for their breakthrough advancements in deep neural networks. if youve ever looked at a tech companys website or watched the keynote for apples latest iphones you might have seen terms like artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml popping up everywhere. these buzzwords are often treated interchangeably though there are subtle and important differences between them. so lets look at what both of these terms imply exactly and how they all relate to each other. to start off lets first define each of these terms and then circle back to the question of how theyre related. while its possible to write a book on ai covering computer science history philosophy and the very nature of intelligence lets keep things simple. the easiest and most accessible way of defining artificial intelligence is simply looking at the words its an attempt to create intelligence. the discipline of ai studies the theory and practice of intelligent systems especially automated decision making and learning. in less abstract terms its an attempt at allowing computers to mimic both humans perception of the world as well as our ability to reason with it. that is a tall order of course but it sums up the ultimate goal of ai research rather well. consider the terminator. this was an imaginary machine perfectly capable of navigating our world incorporating new information about its surroundings and the very dynamic nature of both the world and its inhabitants and making independent decisions without needing any instructions from a human. this definition also makes it abundantly clear that we are a long long way away from achieving true artificial intelligence. still the contributions of todays ai are almost limitless. the benefits of ai are already being felt in many industries including medicine agriculture manufacturing or simply sales and marketing. ai is changing the way we work play and engage with one another from the tools we use to the ways we communicate to the organizations we form. but while a genuinely independent machine perfectly capable of handling itself in all situations is the holy grail of research in this field we have already made significant progress in allowing computers to exhibit humanlike capability when performing at least very specific tasks. to distinguish between these different levels of intelligence researchers in the field often divided artificial intelligence into two or three types ani is often referred to as weak ai  as it is designed to exhibit intelligence or humanlike ability in performing a specific task. one of the next frontiers in ani is maximizing the efficiency of models. this includes optimizing training inference and deployment as well as enhancing the performance of each. agi or strong ai refers to systems that are capable of matching human intelligence in general i.e. in more than a few specific tasks while an artificial super intelligence would be able to surpass human capabilities. for now these comparisons are largely relegated to schools of thought as all deployed ai models are examples of artificial narrow intelligence not agi or asi. there are a number of factors that are accelerating the emergence of agi including the increasing availability of data the development of better algorithms and progress in computer processing. the ai in the movie her is a cultural example of an agi. samantha the artificial intelligence character in the movie has her own thoughts and opinions. shes not a subservient robot but rather an independent being. samantha is capable of using voice and speech recognition natural language processing computer vision and more. these are good examples of artificial narrow intelligence as they show a machine performing a single task really well. however the beauty of general ai is that its capable of integrating all of these individual elements into a single holistic system that can do everything a human can. and while we havent achieved the latter we have achieved remarkable progress with the former. consider selfdriving cars for example. theyre an example of ani as they excel at a specific task navigation and are generally quite capable of identifying elements in their environment other cars pedestrians etc. and incorporating that information into a decision e.g. how to make a turn or when to use the brakes to avoid a collision. virtual assistants like siri and google assistant are examples of the great strides weve made in creating robust ani systems that are capable of creating actual value for businesses and individuals. these assistants use speech recognition an aienabled technology that allows an individual to input voice commands and receive a response. this is achieved through a machine learning model which learns and understands the structure of language by processing sound waves. in any ai system data is collected and processed in order to make predictions. this data is then cleaned and converted into a format that can be used by the model. the model will then generate a prediction which can be viewed as a response to some input. the input may be a question or task and the response can be considered an answer or a solution. other examples include facial and image recognition systems speechtotext machine translation google translate and recommendation engines how amazon or netflix know which products youd like. and this is also where machine learning comes in as the majority of these advances have been made possible thanks to machine learning and deep learning. whether or not agi emerges ai of the future will be embedded everywhere and will touch every part of society from smart devices to loan applications to phone apps. with the rapid growth of ai practically all industries are exploring how they can take advantage of this new technology. as we discussed in this guides introduction machine learning is a branch of computer science that allows computers to automatically infer patterns from data without being explicitly told what these patterns are.  as such machine learning is one way for us to achieve artificial intelligence  i.e. systems capable of making independent humanlike decisions. unfortunately these systems have thus far been restricted to only specific tasks and are therefore examples of narrow ai. in the last two decades many of the most exciting machine learning applications have come from a subset of the field referred to as deep learning . as discussed in the deep learning section of this guide deep learning algorithms have achieved stateoftheart performance in image recognition and natural language processing problems. they have also shown incredible promise in forecasting and reinforcement learning problems. lets circle back and look at how ai ml and dl relate to each other. the following graphic explains the relationship between artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning rather well. ai is the most general of the three and could almost be thought of as the overarching goal of this field of research creating systems capable of mimicking human decision making. a common misconception is that ai is learning. in reality ai is programmed by humans to complete tasks and offer predictions. ai can mimic intelligence but it cannot independently learn like a person. the goal of ai engineers today is to make machines think more like humans and less like machines. another goal of ai researchers today is to make ai behave more like humans. this is particularly challenging as behavior is thought of as the joint product of predisposition and environment which are entirely different concepts between people and machines. machine learning is one way of achieving artificial intelligence while deep learning is a subset of machine learning algorithms which have shown the most promise in dealing with problems involving unstructured data such as image recognition and natural language. machine learning is commonly used as a part of hybrid systems. hybrid systems are a mix of human and machine intelligence that seeks to combine the best of both worlds such as machine learning models that send predictions to humans to be analyzed. it is important to distinguish between machine learning and ai however because machine learning is not the only means for us to create artificially intelligent systems  just the most successful thus far . in the early years of research into this field for example researchers focused on building symbolic ai systems  also referred to as classical ai or good oldfashioned ai gofai . this approach to creating intelligent systems focuses on representing the world as a collection of symbols translating realworld problems into symbolic propositions and then allowing the computer to use propositional logic to solve these problems. these efforts were based on the observation that humans and our languages use symbols to represent both objects in the real world and how they relate to each other. john and pizza are symbols while eat is the relationship between these two objectssymbols. suppose we could represent the entire universe or at least all of the information pertaining to a specific domain such as medicine into such symbols and relations. in that case a computer could then solve these problems using logic. we could also link different propositions together using ifthen rules. for example if hungryjohn then eatjohn pizza. this is an example of an extremely simple rulebased symbolic ai. of course while this simplistic example only uses a few symbols and a single rule a real computer system can store billions of such symbols propositions and rules. such rulebased systems formed the basis for what are known as expert systems  ai tools that rely on a hierarchy of rules to provide solutions to problems. for example consider a doctor diagnosing a patient. these diagnoses are often also rulebased i.e. if the patient has x and y symptoms if their blood sugar is greater than z then they have disease a. as a result ai has had a big impact on cancer diagnosis treatment and prevention. researchers have shown that algorithms are better than humans at classifying cells as cancerous or not. or consider the loan application problem that we discussed in the machine learning article. a panel of experts could easily represent this problem into a series of symbols and rules e.g. if credit score  x and loan amount  y then approve the loan. this could then be used to create an ai expert system that could potentially replace a doctor or a loan officer for making these decisions. symbolic ai enjoys several advantages over machine learning. while machine learning systems practice pattern recognition on historical data symbolic systems only require an expert to define the problem space in terms of symbols propositions and rules. thus it requires next to no training data. additionally since symbolic ai systems comprise a hierarchy of humanreadable rules theyre much easier to interpret than say deep neural networks which are famously opaque and difficult to interpret. lastly an ideal symbolic ai with all the knowledge of the world that a human possesses could potentially be an example of an artificial general or super intelligence capable of genuinely reasoning like a human. with that said while it theoretically makes sense to argue that we could potentially express all knowledge as symbols the reality is that our understanding of the world is incredibly complex and explicitly stating all of human knowledge and common sense as a series of symbols and relations would be a herculean task. some pieces of information may also be difficult to represent as symbols. for example consider image classification. how does one describe a 2 in image form as a symbol while neural networks excel at these tasks simply translating the problem into a symbolic system is difficult. this was one of the major limitations of symbolic ai research in the 70s and 80s. these systems were often considered brittle i.e. unable to handle problems that were out of the norm lacking common sense and therefore toy solutions. these limitations were among the primary drivers of the first ai winter a period of time when most funding into ai systems was withdrawn as research failed to satisfactorily address these problems. as a result aside from some niche applications symbolic ai has generally fallen out of fashion in favor of machine learning which focused on specific tasks i.e. narrow ai but provided far more robust solutions. advances in computing power and the proliferation of data in the internet era have also been a significant boosting factor in enabling machine learning systems whose performance is often limited by the amount and quality of the data available to them. in recent years however researchers have started looking at combining machine learning systems especially neural networks with symbolic ai in an attempt to capitalize on the strengths of both these approaches to ai. this is referred to as neuralsymbolic computing . many business applications require predicting a continuous quantity . for example what is the lifetime value of a customer with a given age and income level or what is the probability of customer churn these are generally referred to as regression problems . in this article we will go over several machine learning algorithms used for solving regression problems. while we wont cover the math in depth we will at least briefly touch on the general mathematical form of these models to provide you with a better understanding of the intuition behind these models. the most common method for solving regression problems is referred to as linear regression . say youre given the following data about the relationship between ph and citric acid to determine wine quality. you can clearly see a linear relationship between the two but as with all real data there is also some noise. since the relationship is linear it makes sense to model this using a straight line. we can extend this to multiple predictors as follows which is also the general form of linear regression but we could potentially draw many straight lines and because of the noise its not entirely clear which one is the best line. for example of the three lines below which is the better one this requires us to define a criterion for what is mathematically considered good vs. bad. since were using this model to predict quantities it makes sense to use the error of our predictions as our yardstick where the error is defined as the difference between the actual value and our prediction. a line that minimizes the overall prediction error is good while a line that has a large overall error is bad. there are different ways of calculating errors. for our purposes well use the sum of squared errors sse . as a simple example of this consider the following example of predicting the weather at this point you might be wondering why were taking the square of the errors and not just the actual value. thats because we dont want negative and positive errors to cancel each other out. if we just summed the error values in the above example wed get 4  3  1  0. this would suggest the model is perfect and give us a false sense of confidence in our model. using squared errors prevents this from happening. thus of all the possible lines we can draw we would select the line with the lowest sse. this is referred to as an objective function  i.e. some value we want to either minimize or maximize. in this case we want to minimize the sse. while we wont go into the mathematical details here this problem can easily be solved using optimization theory  thereby allowing us to find the best line which minimizes the sum of squared errors. once we have found the bestfit line we can make predictions for any new input point by interpolating its value from the straight line. for example while none of our data points have a citric acid of 0.8 we can predict that when citric acid value is 0.8 the ph is 3. while the above example was extremely simple with only one response and one predictor we can easily extend the same logic to more complex problems involving higher dimensions i.e. more predictors. realworld regression problems are often nonlinear . there are many ways to deal with such problems either by extending the linear regression model itself or using other modeling constructs. while theres some noise you can see that this resembles a quadratic curve. lets say we know that the true relationship is given by the equation we could easily extend the linear regression model to this problem by simply taking the square of the dependent variable and adding it as another predictor for the linear regression model. we could do the same for higherorder terms and this is referred to as polynomial regression . other more complex methods include the use of splines . while we wont go into the theory or the math behind this in any detail at a fundamental level splines allow us to fit different nonlinear functions to different parts of the input space while ensuring that the functions are smooth i.e. connected at the boundaries between these regions. the result is a highly flexible model that can fit nonlinear data more closely. however this may come at the expense of overfitting as the model may be fitting to random noise instead of the actual patterns. as a result splines and polynomial regression should be used with care and evaluated using crossvalidation to ensure that the model we train can be generalized. we may also use nonparametric methods for regression problems. the simplest of these may just be knearest neighbor regression . in this method given historical data and a new data point we want a prediction for we simply find the k data points closest to this new point and predict its value to be the mean of these k points. we can also use decision trees for regression problems. here we split the data into different subsets based on a set of criteria. we may then assign a fixed value to each leaf node as its prediction e.g. the mean of all the data points belonging to that leaf node. see the example below of using decision tree regression for predicting the number of hours played based on different weather conditions alternatively we could also fit a separate linear regression model for each of the leaf nodes. as with many other machine learning problems we can also use deep learning and neural networks to solve nonlinear regression problems. lets extend the idea of predicting a continuous variable to probabilities. say we wanted to predict the probability of a customer canceling their subscription to our service. since probability is a continuous variable it naturally extends itself to regression. however its a continuous variable capped by two constraints a probability can neither be negative nor greater than 1. regular linear regression is incapable of abiding by these constraints and thus the logistic model was born. logistic regression is an extension of linear regression which straddles the line between regression and classification. it works on the same principle as linear regression but with a key difference the response is the natural log of the odds of an event occurring . odds  in statistics refers to the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring for example say the probability of barcelona winning their next match is 30. then the odds for their victory are 37 or 37. this is also the nomenclature used in gambling though gambling sites often show odds against an event and not odds for. the odds against barcelona in this case would be 73. statistically the most salient aspect of using the natural log of odds is that while the output of the regression model is still unconstrained when we convert the log odds back to probabilities these are capped to between 0 and 1 thus solving our problem while we wont go into the mathematical details of why that is the case you can see below a graph of the output probability p as the value of the independent variable changes thus weve successfully extended the linear regression model to predict probabilities. once we have an estimate for the probability of an event occurring classification is just one step away. if we set a certain probability as a threshold  we can classify each data point e.g. each customer into one of two classes. choosing this threshold is largely dependent on the application. for example a luxury carmaker that operates on high margins and low volumes may want to be highly proactive and personally check in with customers with even a 20 probability of churn. if churn is not missioncritical or we simply dont have the resources to handle individual customers we may want to set this threshold much higher e.g. 90 so we are alerted to only the most urgent prospects. in the previous section we dealt with examples of regression problems  where we want to predict a continuous variable. the second major type of supervised learning problem is classification where we want to assign each sample into one of two or more categories . for example a bank may want to determine if a loan applicant will repay their loan or not. or an email provider might want to build a system that filters out spam from your inbox. in both these cases we have only two possible classescategories but its also possible to handle problems with multiple options. for example a leadscoring system might want to distinguish between hot neutral and cold leads. computer vision problems are often also multiclass problems  as we wish to identify multiple types of objects cars people traffic signs etc.. in this article well examine some of the algorithms used for classification problems. however the focus here will be on building intuition and so we wont be covering the math behind these algorithms in any detail. well also focus on only binary classification problems i.e. those with only two options for simplicity. one of the simplest classification algorithms is knn classification . say we have historical data with labels and a new point whose label we want to determine. in this method we simply find the k points closest to the new point and assign its label to be the mode the most commonly occurring class of these k points. for example consider the image below. if k3  then the label of the green point is a red triangle because among the three points closest to it the majority   are red triangles. as we discussed in the regression section  the knn algorithm can also solve nonlinear regression problems. another commonly used classification algorithm is svm. consider the following example where we want to filter out spam emails. the xaxis is the number of times the word buy appears in the email and the yaxis is the number of other people who have received the same email. when plotted the data looks like this the blue points are legitimate emails and the red points are spam. spam emails presumably want you to buy things and are sent to more people so it makes sense that emails sent out to a large number of people with many mentions of the word buy are spam. more importantly we see that we can clearly separate the two classes using a straight line but as with linear regression this raises the question which line is the best as shown below we can draw many possible lines all of which perfectly separate between the two classes. we may want to thus think about defining what makes one line better than another. this is somewhat dependent on the problem were trying to solve and well revisit this point later on. for now though a reasonable criterion may be to choose the line which maximizes the margin between the two classes  that is the line which is as far away as possible from the most extreme examples of either class. this raises another question how can we translate this into a mathematical problem instead of just doing it by eye consider the following diagram we can find the best line by first drawing two lines that only touch the outermost points of each class. note also that both of these lines are parallel to each other. these lines are called support vectors  hence the name of the algorithm. the best line is then a line that is parallel to both of these lines and also equidistant from them i.e. its the same distance from each. the distance between the support vectors and the classifier line is called the margin  and we want to maximize this. this is the most common or default way in which svm selects the best classifier line. this may not always be the ideal way of doing things however. for example say we were working on determining if a tumor is benign or malignant. in this case the cost of making a mistake is not the same for each class. if we classify a malignant tumor as benign it could potentially cost the patient their life while mistaking a benign tumor as malignant might only require further testing. clearly one mistake is worse than the other. depending on the application and how careful we want to be we may choose to assign a greater weight to either type of mistake. as such we may decide to move the line further away from one class or even deliberately mislabel some of the data points simply because we want to be extremely cautious about making a mistake. next lets consider scenarios where the two classes cannot be cleanly separated via a straight line. sometimes it may not be possible to perfectly classify points using a straight line. we could then resort to nonlinear methods discussed later but for now lets stick to only straight lines. in that case we may be willing to take an imperfect classifier. this is also called a soft classifier  as it does not classify all points correctly. on the other hand a hard classifier would refer to the examples weve discussed thus far which perfectly classify all data points. in the above image we see that the soft classifier weve selected misclassifies three points highlighted in yellow. at the same time we also see two blue points and two red points circled in blue that are extremely close to the line and are nearmistakes. thus our classifier has a very small margin between the two classes. consider a second possible classifier we could draw for the same data in this case we have five misclassified points compared to three before but the line has a wider margin and very few points that are nearmisses or extremely close to the line. this demonstrates an inherent tradeoff with soft classifiers. we can choose to either minimize errors or maximize the margin between the two classes. while we wont show the mathematical details here we can assign different weights to either of these options depending on how important higher accuracy is compared to having a cleaner less ambiguous boundary. this is an example of a model hyperparameter  a variable that we specify for the algorithm and which defines or in some way constrains the form that our model will take. in this case we see that while a straight line cannot separate these points a circle can. how can we solve this problem as weve seen above one option may be to use nonlinear methods like knn classification or classification trees. since these are nonparametric methods and dont specify a particular form for the model e.g. that it needs to be a straight line they are particularly wellsuited for nonlinear problems. however svm can also be extended to solving this problem by transforming the data to achieve linear separation between the classes. for example we can see that all the points within a circle of radius 2 are red and those outside it are blue. in a simple case like this if we convert the data from cartesian to polar coordinates. the resulting plot is shown below where the xaxis is the radial distance from the origin and the yaxis is the angle in radians as can be seen the classes are now easily separated using a straight line. thus we would simply feed the svm algorithm this transformed version of the data. in more complex scenarios especially when we have multidimensional problems and dont know that the ideal classifier is for example a circle we may not know which transformation to use. in other cases the transformation may be computationally inefficient. in these cases we can transform the problem by adding more dimensions to it. this is referred to as the kernel trick or kernel svm and allows us to create nonlinear classification boundaries like the one below an explanation of the mechanics or the math of how and why kernel svm works is beyond the scope of this article. still its an important detail to know in order for you to have a comprehensive understanding of the kinds of problems the svm algorithm can solve. kernel methods should be used with svm with caution however. by adding more dimensions to the problem and allowing for nonlinear boundaries we are creating a more flexible model . this can easily lead to overfitting . another means of solving classification problems  and one thats exceptionally wellsuited to nonlinear problems  is the use of a decision tree . since decision trees can be used for both classification and regression problems see the regression section the algorithm is sometimes referred to as cart classification and regression trees . in this method we divide the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on a series of binary yesno questions. consider the following decision tree for deciding if we should play football or not based on how the weather affected past games the balls at the leaf nodes indicate whether we were able to successfully finish a game blue with the given weather conditions or whether the game had to be interrupted due to poor weather red. we see that on most rainy days with wind we were forced to cancel our games. as such the mode of this leaf node is red and we would classify any future rainy and windy days as red i.e. we probably shouldnt play on those days. note that decision trees are also an excellent example of how machine learning methods differ from more traditional forms of ai. you might recall that in the what is the difference between machine learning and ai section we discussed something called expert systems  which are a hierarchy of ifelse rules that allow a computer to make a decision. a decision tree is also a hierarchy of binary rules but the key difference between the two is that the rules in an expert system are defined by a human expert. on the other hand decision trees figure out what the splitting criteria at stage i.e. the rules should be by themselves  which is why we say that the machine is learning . how does it do that you might have noticed that each of the leaf nodes consists mostly of one class  for example the sunny  normal humidity node is mostly blue while the rainy  windy node is mostly red. thats by design. at each stage of building the decision tree the computer will look at all of the possible options it has and choose the splitting criterion that minimizes the impurity of the subsequent nodes  that is it tries to ensure that each of the nodes has points belonging to only one class if possible. of course if we allow the computer to keep splitting the data into smaller and smaller subsets i.e. a deep tree we might eventually end up with a scenario where each leaf node only contains one or very few data points. this might lead to overfitting . therefore the maximum allowable depth is one of the most important hyperparameters when using treebased methods. deep learning is another excellent example of a classification method. in fact deep learning models are great at solving problems with multiple classes. theyre also particularly effective at dealing with nonlinear relationships and unstructured problems as theyre able to tease out the more abstract interactions between different terms. in the what is machine learning section of the guide we considered the example of a bank trying to determine whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not. this is an example of a problem where we have relatively structured data. we know for each applicant specific values of different metrics that we think are important and relevant to solving their problem e.g. their income credit score etc.. these metrics are often referred to as features or predictors. but what about a facial recognition problem say we have two pictures of the same person looking in different directions. if we simply fed these two images as a string of pixels to a classical ml algorithm it might not recognize that they are the same person because the string of pixels that it received might be quite different based on lightning conditions the direction in which the person is looking and so on. instead it would make far more sense for us to try and extract useful features from the image first and then feed these as the inputs to the algorithm. for example we might want to determine what the colour of their skin is the shape of their face the length of their nose the colour of their eyes and so on. since these will remain the same regardless of lighting conditions or the orientation of their face this might be a far more robust solution. this however raises another problem as we might need another machine learning algorithm to for example distinguish between the persons face and hair. once weve identified the hair we may then need a second machine learning algorithm to distinguish between the different types of hair colours since hair colours arent discrete and red hair can be many different colours in reality. as such we may need to break down the problem into layers of smaller subproblems also solved using machine learning to first extract the relevant structured features before we can feed them to the final algorithm which actually classifies faces. deep learning on the other hand tries to circumvent this problem as it doesnt require us to determine these intermediate features. instead we can simply feed it the raw unstructured image and it can figure out on its own what these relevant features might be. in doing so it presents two significant benefits compared to classical machine learning algorithms this is also why deep learning algorithms are often considered black boxes. the complexity of their structure and the large number of layers in them means we cant precisely extract information about specific features as we might do with a linear regression model where the coefficient for each feature imparts direct and easily interpretable information about the linear relationship between the features and the response. as weve discussed before a neural network is deep when it contains multiple layers. while different practitioners might differ on exactly what the threshold for a deep neural network is a neural network with more than three layers is often considered as being deep. this begs the question however why do neural networks need to be deep to answer this question recall how in the previous section we discussed that solving a facial recognition problem may require the creation of a pipeline with multiple layers of subproblems in order to use classical ml algorithms. well it turns out that thats more or less also how deep learning algorithms work. for example in an image classification problem research has shown that each of the layers or a group of them will tend to specialize toward extracting specific pieces of information about the image. for example some layers might focus on the shapes in the image while others might focus on colors. adding more layers can therefore allow neural networks to more granularly extract information  that is identify more types of features. deeper layers also allow the neural network to learn about the more abstract interactions between different features. for example the impact credit score has on a persons ability to repay a loan may be very different based on whether theyre a student or a business owner. in a regression setting the data scientist would need to manually specify any such interaction terms. but as we discussed before we may not always know which interaction terms are relevant while a deep neural network would be able to do the job for us. its prowess with unstructured data has allowed deep learning to produce massive advances in the fields of computer vision object detection and natural language processing all of which involve unstructured data and classification for example classifying the different objects in an image as a car or a pedestrian. machine learning works by recognizing the patterns in past data and then using them to predict future outcomes. to build a successful predictive model you need data that is relevant to the outcome of interest. this data can take many forms  from number values temperature cost of a commodity etc to time values dates elapsed times to text images video and audio. fortunately the explosion in computing and sensor technology combined with the internet has enabled us to capture and store data at exponentially increasing rates. the trick is getting the right data for any particular problem  most businesses capture this in their existing technology stacks and a lot of this data is available for free online. structured versus unstructured data is a common topic in the field of data science where a structured dataset typically has a welldefined schema and is organized in a table with rows and columns. unstructured data on the other hand is often messy and difficult to process. structured and unstructured data can both be the fuel for successful machine learning models. lets dive into the details of structured versus unstructured data including data formats data storage data sources analysis and more. structured data is quantifiable and easy to search and analyze and comes in predefined formats such as csv excel xml or json while unstructured data can be in a variety of less welldefined formats including pdfs images audio or video. structured data is typically a result of a welldefined schema which is often created by human experts. its easy for people to add or change the schema of structured data but it can be very difficult to do so with unstructured data. in short structured data is searchable and organized in a table making it easy to find patterns and relationships. its also possible to analyze and gain value from unstructured data such as by using text extraction on pdfs followed by text classification but its a much more difficult task. many popular business tools like hubspot salesforce or snowflake are sources of structured data. akkios sample datasets which are in csv format are also examples of structured data. more broadly speaking any welldefined csv or excel file is an example of structured data millions of examples of which are available on sites like kaggle or data.gov. for the purpose of predictive modeling the most common type of unstructured data is text. this includes text forms like customer feedback forms as well as emails comments on social media sites product reviews or even notes taken during sales calls or business meetings. as weve highlighted unstructured data goes beyond text and includes audio and video. for example youtube reviews are another source of unstructured data. youtube videos also include aigenerated transcriptions or speechtotext. given that text data text classification could be used to mine those reviews for insights. structured data is often stored in data warehouses while unstructured data is stored in data lakes. a warehouse stores structured datasets and typically relies on more traditional databases like sql server and oracle for storage while a data lake stores less welldefined datasets. some of the most wellknown machine learning models in use today are fueled by structured data. for example amazon uses its database of customer purchasing patterns and preferences to recommend items that are likely to be of interest to a particular customer. other machine learning models are fueled by unstructured data. tesla uses its fleet of selfdriving cars to collect data about driving patterns and conditions. the data is used for teaching selfdriving cars how to avoid collisions and navigate through varying driving conditions. another example is seen in google photos. when you take a photo googles machine learning models scan the image an unstructured data type to find what category it falls into. then users can search their own previously unlabeled photos by categories like nature or people. most analytics tools are designed for structured data making it easier than ever to analyze and gain value from structured data. with akkio  for instance you can upload structured data to build and deploy ai models in minutes. in the background machine learning algorithms scan and digest the tabular data to find patterns creating a model that can be deployed to find those patterns in new data. unstructured data analysis is a lesscommon task but its still highly important for businesses looking to gain value from their pdfs image and audio data and so on. analyzing unstructured data is a complicated task which is why its ignored by many businesses. unstructured data can be difficult to process and understand because its messy and in a variety of formats. unstructured data may also be qualitative instead of quantitative making it even harder to analyze. one usecase for unstructured data is to analyze reviews and comments on social media both from your own company and from competitors to inform competitive strategy. another usecase is market analysis to find new opportunities. by analyzing unstructured market data such as social media posts that mention customer needs businesses can uncover opportunities for new products and features that may meet the needs of these potential customers. quantitative data is a numerical set of information such as the height and weight of each person in a group alongside the size of the group. quantitative data can be further divided into two subcategories discrete and continuous data. discrete data does not include measurements which are along a spectrum but instead refers to counting numbers like the number of products in a customers shopping cart or a count of financial transactions. continuous data on the other hand refers to data that can meaningfully be broken down into smaller units or placed on a scale like a customers income an employees salary or the dollar size of a financial transaction. qualitative data is nonnumeric such as whether or not a transaction is fraudulent whether a review has positive or negative sentiment or whether a sales deal has a high or low likelihood of being closed. qualitative data is largely categorical but it also includes things like text whether its a tweet a customer support ticket or documentation. by the very meaning of the word categorical data is simply data relating to categories while quantitative data relates to quantities. lets dive more deeply into the differences between quantitative and qualitative data with the latter focusing on categorical data. it can be difficult to determine if your data is categorical or quantitative but there are a few steps you can take to find out. if your data has a numerical range of values like income age transaction size or similar its quantitative. if on the other hand there are categories like yes maybe and no its categorical. you should also consider the type of answers youre expecting from your data. are you expecting an answer that has a range of values or just one set of values if youre expecting one set of values like fraud or not fraud then its categorical. if youre expecting a range of values like a certain dollar amount then its quantitative. quantitative data can be used to fuel a wide range of ai models. lets explore a few examples. quantitative machine learning algorithms can use various forms of regression analysis for instance to find the relationship between variables. to give a simple example if one variable is the weight of a patient and the other variable is the height of a patient then the relationship between these variables can be found by running regression analysis on a set of patients. categorical data can also fuel a wide range of ai usecases. here are just a couple of examples. categorical machine learning algorithms including clustering algorithms are used to identify groups within a dataset where the groups are based on similarity. the technical algorithm names include nave bayes and knearest neighbors. understanding the intricacies of these complex algorithms used to be a prerequisite to ai modeling but you can now build and deploy these models in minutes with no technical expertise needed. there are pros and cons to each type of data and which data type to use depends on the situation. quantitative data is inherently more precise than categorical data as theres greater granularity in quantitative data. for example a height of 72.5 inches is a lot more precise than the category tall. an income of 12000 is a lot more precise than the category poor. by using categories some information can be lost. for instance one american with an annual income of 0 and another with an annual income of 12000 are both classified in the same legal categorypovertyeven with significant differences in living situations. similarly someone with a net worth of 30 million and someone with a net worth of 100 billion are both classified as ultrahighnetworth individuals even while there are tens of thousands of individuals in the former category and just a few in the latter category. one disadvantage of quantitative data is that its harder to make sense of and model than categorical data. categorical data inherently simplifies data by reducing the number of data points. theres no simple answer as to whats the more common data type. categorical data is often easier to collect. for example given someones facebook profile you can likely get data on their race gender their favorite food their interests their education their political party and more which are all examples of categorical data. on the other hand you probably wouldnt be able to find out their exact income their weight their spending habits or other exact quantitative metrics with some exceptions like age. under the hood however the situation is quite different as facebook collects vast amounts of data on each of its users much of which is quantitative such as the amount of time spent viewing a post the number of posts viewed the number of profile views the number of link clicks the number of application opens and so on. ultimately we create large amounts of both data types every day with virtually every action we take. when you pick up a new smartphone sensors recognize that it was picked up by tracking the exact spatial location of your phone at any point in time which is an example of quantitative data. then as it recognizes that your phone was picked up it may change a variable like status to be active instead of inactive causing your phones lock screen to light up. time series data is a type of data that records events happening over time which is especially useful in predicting future events. to give a very simple example heres a time series dataset with three data points in 1975 earths global surface temperature was anomalous by 0.0 degrees celsius in 1995 it was 0.5 degrees celsius higher than normal and in 2015 it was 0.9 degrees celsius higher than normal. one of the key tenets of time series data is that when something happens is as important as what happens. in marketing for example the time it takes a customer to go through the steps of the marketing funnel is an important predictor of revenue. one of the most important uses of time series data is forecasting. this is because the past is the best predictor of the future. lets explore some common applications of timeseries data including forecasting and more. marketing is a journey and the customers journey through the marketing funnel can seem unpredictable. however there are many ways to predict the customers journey and reach them at the appropriate time to increase customer engagement and conversion rates. by understanding customer journeys marketers can also create a more relevant and compelling content experience for each stage of the journey. for example if you are running a marketing campaign on instagram and want to know how many clicks your advertisements will receive you could forecast clicks based on historical data. to give another example time series forecasting can be used to predict when customers will make their next purchase. this allows companies to make decisions about when to launch new products and when to send emails or other consumer messaging. revenue runrate is predicting revenue based on what has happened in the past. this is an important metric for companies because it helps them plan for future revenue needs. revenue runrate is an annual metric which is traditionally calculated by multiplying the average revenue per month by 12 or the average revenue per quarter by 4. this will give a rough estimate of how much revenue the company will have per year. that said this is a very rough method of estimating revenue which can be highly inaccurate. for example businesses like fitness centers typically outperform in january due to new years resolutioners so they wouldnt be able to accurately forecast revenue with traditional means. the opposite situation holds true for a landscaping company which likely wont see much business in january. a number of other variables impact revenue as well from dynamic budgets to new competitors or new product innovation. traditional calculations which are based purely on multiplying historical revenue are ignoring all these other factors. using akkios forecasting you can accurately predict revenue runrate based on any number of complex variables in your data. predicting stock and crypto prices is notoriously difficult especially considering the technical difficulties of manually building and deploying forecasting models. that said for investors who are interested in forecasting assets time series data and machine learning are musthaves. with akkio you can connect time series data of stock and crypto assets to forecast prices. its important to remember that stocks and crypto are different types of investments as crypto markets are much smaller and more volatile. investors should be wary of their own emotions when investing in stocks and crypto. manufacturers are using time series ai for predictive maintenance and monitoring equipment health. the ai systems are able to identify when changes need to be made to improve efficiency. they are also able to predict when equipment will break down and send alerts before it happens. these technologies are saving manufacturers money by not having to spend on unexpected repairs or urgently replace machinery when it is no longer working. for nonexperts finding highquality time series datasets is a challenge. fortunately there are a huge amount of free highquality time series dataset sources available online. lets explore a couple of time series dataset sources. the uci repository features 48 timeseries datasets ranging from air quality to sales forecasting data. most of the data is offered in csv format so its easy to read with tools like akkio with no manual preprocessing needed. just connect a dataset and youre good to go the world bank provides a wildly extensive databank featuring 79 databases for 264 countries with data as far back as 1960. the world development indicators database for example includes over 1440 data columns to pick from ranging from highlevel indicators like percent access to electricity to very niche indicators like rural population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters. the education statistics database includes almost 4000 data columns. theres no easy answer to how many timeseries datasets are offered but if you treat each potential timeseries dataset as a univariate problem then there are millions of datasets from this source alone 79 databases across 264 countries with an average of 2000 data columns. time series data can be a particularly tricky data type to work with for a number of reasons. weve highlighted some special considerations to keep in mind when working with timeseries data. in a timeseries dataset the temporal aspect is crucial but many machine learning algorithms dont use this temporal aspect which creates misleading models that arent actually predictive of the future. for example a random walk model is a stochastic process which means that its simply not possible for it to accurately predict future outcomes from historical data. to give another example basic regression models ignore temporal correlation in the observed data and predict the next value of the time series based merely on linear regression methods. moreover many time series models can easily overfit to the data by finding spurious correlations instead of causal variables. for example theres a positive correlation between ice cream sales and murder but obviously not because eating ice cream makes you want to murder people. this is whats known as a spurious correlation. in the case of ice cream sales and murder whats happening is that ice cream sales increase in the summer which is when more people go outside causing a natural increase in crime fewer crimes are committed when everyones bundled up inside during the winter versus say when theres a sports events in the summer with 50000 attendees packed in a stadium. modeling time series data is an intensive effort requiring preprocessing data cleaning stationarity tests stationarization methods like detrending or differencing finding optimal parameters and more. doing this manually requires a high degree of technical expertise not to mention a large time commitment. with akkio these complex processes are automated in the backend so you can forecast data effortlessly. if youve ever considered investing youve likely read a financial disclaimer along the lines of past performance is no guarantee of future results. its actually a legal requirement for asset management firms to give such a disclaimer because well theres really no way to know what the future holds. the best we can do is assign probabilities to certain values. indeed even generating accurate probabilities is immensely challenging as the world is constantly changing. predicting covid19 cases is a great example of the challenges of time series forecasting as virtually all forecasts failed . even now accurate forecasts are extremely difficult considering that much past data is no longer relevant for the future given new vaccines new strains and everchanging regulations around travel social distancing quarantines and so on. feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing data. one challenge with time series data is that its often not stationary. stationarity means that a time series is a sequence of observations of the same variable taken at equally spaced times. if the observations are equally spaced in time and do not contain any trends or seasonality then its stationary. creating stationary data is a form of feature engineering and the two most common techniques for transforming time series into stationary data are differencing and transforming. that said with nocode ai tools like akkio you can build and deploy time series models without any manual feature engineering needed as this is all done automatically after a dataset is connected. data is the fuel that makes machine learning tick. for the most part the more data you have the more accurate your model will be but there are many cases where you can get by with less. machine learning models are pattern matching machines. they can only capture and predict patterns that have been seen before. this is the one big catch with machine learning. if you want to predict what happens with new data the model has to have seen similar data before. its also important to note that theres no golden rule for how much data you need. for example while akkios lead scoring demo dataset has over 40000 rows of data the text classification demo dataset has just 1000 rows of data and both achieve roughly 90 accuracy. meanwhile the credit card fraud demo dataset has nearly 300000 rows of data its best to explore the modeling process for your dataset and see what it takes to get high accuracy. accurate machine learning models can be made with as little as a few hundred rows of data. if you truly have extremely little data say less than a few hundred rows you can try a few things. one is data augmentation a process where data is generated by adding in fake data examples. you can also merge in other datasets whether internal or external on shared columns to increase the overall dataset size. for example suppose youre building a model to classify customer support tickets based on urgency. if you need more data youll want to ensure that you have a pipeline in place thats generating this data for you. in such a case your support teams should be tagging the urgency of incoming tickets so you can later export this data to fuel your machine learning model. depending on the usecase you can even turn to crowdsourcing platforms like amazon mechanical turk. these platforms allow you to hire people from all over the world to do small tasks for you at low prices like collecting and labelling data. you may not want to do this if youre a small company with limited resources but if youre a large company and want more data quickly this may be a good option for you. yet another method is to scrape data from the internet which is again usecase dependent but potentially an easy way to boost your dataset size given the open nature of a lot of internet data such as social media posts. there are instances when it feels like you could have too much data. if your dataset is too large it becomes difficult to explore and understand what the data is telling you. this is particularly the case with big data in the order of many gigabytes or even terabytes which cannot be analyzed with regular tools like excel or even typical python pandas code. given that its possible to make highquality machine learning models with much smaller datasets this problem can be solved by sampling from the larger dataset and using the derived smaller sample to build and deploy models. a good example of a massive ai model is googles latest language model  which is an incredible 1.6 trillion parameters in sizetoo large for us to practically comprehend though for comparison there are just 86 billion neurons in the human brain. at the same time its possible to build machine learning models that are around 10 orders of magnitude smaller than googles language model. for example the perceptron is a classifier that was developed in the 1950s. these singlelayer neural networks are trained by assigning inputs to different outputs with the network adjusting its weights until it can correctly predict the output for new inputs. the perceptron is limited by its lack of memory and by not being able to extrapolate relationships between data points that it might not have seen but at its core it can be the basis of a functioning model with just a few parameters. its important to remember that quantity isnt everything when it comes to data. even if you have a lot of data your model may not work well. in order to have high quality models you need high quality data. this means that your data needs to be clean and easy to work with so that it can be used effectively. in other words its better to have a small highquality dataset thats indicative of the problem that youre trying to solve than a large generic dataset riddled with quality issues. after all not all data is valuable. as nate silver founder of fivethirtyeight says  every day three times per second we produce the equivalent of the amount of data that the library of congress has in its entire print collection right but most of it is like cat videos on youtube or 13yearolds exchanging text messages about the next twilight movie. machine learning is getting easier and faster. theres no need to waste a lot of time on preparation as a huge dataset isnt a prerequisite. as adam savage puts it in the spirit of science there really is no such thing as a failed experiment. simply experiment and see how much data you need. in the last few years machine learning and ai tools have been getting simpler and faster. the days of waiting weeks or months for building and deploying models are over. with akkio you can build a model in as little as 10 seconds which means that the process of figuring out how much data you really need for an effective model is quick and effortless. with traditional machine learning you typically need a large dataset in order to get sufficient training data. but with akkio its possible to create compelling models with as little as 100 or 1000 examples. as weve explored if you find that youre not getting great results with a small dataset you can always try merging on new data data augmentation crowdsourcing platforms or simply turning to online dataset sources. preparing your data for the training of a machine learning model can range from simply connecting your existing business operations technology platforms salesforce marketo and hubspot etc and datastores snowflake google big query etc to business wide data hygiene programs that take months but yield clean data for optimum performance. you also need to narrow down the dataset used for training so it only has the information available to you when you want to predict a key outcome. we have designed akkio to work with messy data as well as clean  and are firm believers in capturing 90 of the value of machine learning at a fraction of the cost of a data hygiene initiative. to learn more about preparing your data for machine learning click here . the performance of a machine learning model is primarily dependent on the predictive accuracy of its training dataset with respect to the outcome of interest. if you were able to know everything about a system quantum physics aside you would be able to perfectly predict its future state. in reality most datasets contain a small subset of information about a system  but that is often more than enough to build a valuable ml model. that said adding in additional data can often help improve predictive performance. this is called data augmentation. to learn more about data augmentation for machine learning click here . one very important thing to be aware of when using machine learning is that biases in the dataset used to train the model will be reflected in the decision making of the model itself. sometimes these biases are not obvious in your data  take for example zip or postal codes. location information encodes a lot of information that might not be obvious at first glance  everything from weather to population density to income housing to demographics information like age and ethnicity. these patterns can be helpful but also have the potential to be harmful when the models are used in ways that reinforce unwanted discriminatory outcomes both ethically and legally. click here to learn more about bias in machine learning and how to minimize it. machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that is focused on systems that can learn from data. while well explore some of the top applications of machine learning across a number of industries the academic world is also using ai largely for research in areas such as biology chemistry and materials science. renewable energy is one of the fastestgrowing sources of power generation worldwide. in 2020 it accounted for 80 percent of new power capacity globally. ai is critical for successful adoption. ai can balance electricity supply and demand needs in realtime optimize energy use and storage to reduce rates and help integrate new clean sources into existing infrastructures. ai can also predict and prevent power outages in the future by learning from past events. for example when a grid is overwhelmed by demand ai can forecast the trajectory for that grids flow of energy and power usage then act to prevent a power outage. ai can also predict when a power outage will occur in the future so utilities can take proactive measures to minimize the outages effects. additionally ai can even help with wind energy. the power of the wind is everpresent but harnessing it is not easy. windmills have been used for centuries to capture wind power but this process is difficult and costly. but now ai can change the game. ai can calculate how wind turbines should be rotated so that as few turbines as possible are in the wind shadow of the other. using data collected from the terrain the height and size of the turbines and meteorological data ai can work out how wind turbines should be rotated to harness the wind. the insurance industry is highly competitive. the simple fact is that if you are not consistently profitable you will be driven out of the market. to maintain profitability insurance firms must be able to accurately predict highrisk highcost individuals. indeed data shows that 70 percent of new north american insurance companies fail within 10 years. this is the status quo as insurance firms often cannot accurately price their plans leading to tremendous losses. ai has been shown to be highly accurate when it comes to predicting future claims costs. this accuracy allows you to assess the risk of insuring an individual based on their past claims history and use this information to correctly price your premiums. this is crucial because it will allow you to stay profitable in a highrisk industry where you are always at risk of being driven out of business by adverse selection. with akkio aipowered cost modeling can be done in clicks enabling insurers to leapfrog competitors that are stuck using traditional laborious and inaccurate cost models. this cost modeling solves one of the biggest problems insurers face today choosing who to insure and at what rates. in the insurance industry its all about risk management. and when youre making predictions about risk you want to do it right. in the past the industry relied on outdated modeling techniques that often led to under or overpricing claims. that led to higher premiums for consumers and a host of other problems. but ai is solving this problem. with these new machine learning techniques its possible to accurately predict a claim cost and build accurate prediction models within minutes. not only that but insurers can even build models to predict how claims costs will change and account for case estimation changes. that means insurance companies can price their policies more accurately and offer lower premiums for consumers leading to lower costs of coverage for everyone. it also helps insurers be more competitive and attract more customers which is especially important as the industry faces stiff competition. akkios platform makes this possible by enabling users to create models based on their own data and then deploy them across any number of environments with just a few clicks. this reduces the need for costly and timeconsuming custom development work and translates into lower costs for the company overall. it also enables insurers to respond faster to a changing insurance market which provides a critical edge against competitors that are still relying on outdated techniques like regression modeling in excel. the result is an improved customer experience that translates into higher sales volume and happier shareholders. claims are a major expense for insurance companies and a frustrating process for policyholders. at the same time insurance claims are extremely common  as by the age of 34 every person driving since they were 16 are likely to have filed at least one car insurance claim. the inefficiencies in processing claims is bad for both parties the customer wastes time and the insurance company spends more on processing than they could have spent on settling the claim. akkios nocode machine learning can model when its best to pay off claims automatically so that you can minimize wait times for customers and maximize roi for your business. predicting when a customer will make a claim is not simple. your risk profile changes over time and so does the competitiveness of your market. given the right historical data akkios machine learning models take all of this into account making it easy to find the optimal solution for your specific needs. simply upload your data and let akkio do the heavy lifting giving you more time to focus on what really matters running your business. insurance companies are always searching for new ways to attract new customers and they need to optimize their marketing efforts to help them grow. a key problem that many insurance companies are struggling with is how to make accurate pricing decisions. given that insurance is sold by quoting a policy accurately estimating the conversion rate from quote to policy is essential. akkio allows you to gather historical data make estimates about the probability of conversion and then use those predictions to drive your pricing decisions. accurately modeling insurance conversion is key because it is an important determinant of insurance company profitability. a key benefit of an aibased approach is that it allows insurance companies to adjust prices for customer segments without manually creating and testing a wide range of pricing variants. this ensures that marketing dollars are spent effectively and efficiently on segments where there is the greatest chance of conversion. with over 40 billion in insurance fraud in the us alone according to fbi statistics its no wonder that insurers are looking for ways to reduce fraudulent payouts. one solution is to use machine learning to create models that can predict the probability of a claim being legitimate or not. fraudulent claim modeling is an excellent example of how predictive modeling can be used to analyze fraud in the insurance industry. using a model built on past payouts an insurer could for instance apply a scoring system to claims and automatically reject or flag those with high probability of being fraudulent. fraudulent claims dont just reduce the bottomline for insurers they can even lead directly to corporate bankruptcy as research indicates . moreover fraud hurts consumers who pay up to 700 a year in the form of increased premiums in the us. the traditional means of detecting fraud are inefficient and ineffective as its impossible for humans to manually analyze vast amounts of data at scale which lets fraud slip through the cracks. akkios potential in this area goes beyond the insurance industry. modeling fraud is a popular usecase in the financial sector as well for example to help eliminate fraudulent credit card applications and transactions. many life insurance companies do not underwrite customers who suffered from some serious diseases such as cancer. this is because it requires them to spend a long and expensive medical assessment process on the customer. in insurance the term impaired refers to applicants who dont meet the standard criteria to obtain a very affordable rate. as a result impaired applicants are often un or underinsured. its a wise business decision to increase the coverage for impaired customers and akkios ai is able to provide that capability. while many who suffer from a serious disease can be accurately identified through a questionnaire akkio can achieve an even higher degree of accuracy by integrating the applicants medical history and conditions. aidriven predictive models use these factors to predict the risk of underwriting a serious disease survivor. the model predicts the risk of death which is the ultimate impairment in insurance. for insurers its possible to build the model in just minutes opening up a new line of business and boosting the bottom line. credit card fraud is a huge problem costing billions of dollars per year. fraudulent transactions cost 28 billion in 2018 and they continue to grow rapidly. in fact annual losses are expected to exceed 40 billion by the end of the decade. with akkios nocode machine learning the likelihood of fraudulent transactions can be predicted effortlessly. this reduces the number of fraudulent transactions while at the same time increases customer satisfaction. for banks this means less cost per transaction and more revenue and profit. akkios fraud detection for credit card transactions is one example of how akkio can help banks. by using a historical transaction dataset machine learning models identify suspicious patterns and account for factors that are often overlooked in credit card transactions like ip address changes highrisk browsing behavior or a low level of engagement with the transaction. by using proprietary ai training methods akkio can be used to build fraudulent transaction models in minutes which can be deployed in any setting via api. credit default rate is the percentage of loans that default. the credit default rate problem is difficult to model due to its complexity with many factors influencing an individuals or companys likelihood of default such as industry credit score income and time. understanding the factors that lead to credit card defaults can help lenders better assess the risk of lending to borrowers and ultimately boost the bottomline. credit risk is a measure of the likelihood that a person will be unable to repay a debt and this is what lenders use to determine whether or not to offer credit. in finance credit risk is the risk of default on an obligation that arises due to the uncertainty of future cash flow. akkios api can help any organization that needs accurate credit risk models in a fraction of the time it would take to build them on their own. akkio makes it easy to build a model that predicts the likelihood of default based on data from the past. in addition akkio can be used for automatic model retraining so that once a model is built its easy to maintain and update as needed. this makes it possible for organizations not just to save time on predictive modeling tasks but also to be confident in their models at all times. digital wealth management is a competitive field. in this market its not just about having the best investment products but also about how to distribute them effectively while managing client assets. akkios machine learning algorithms can be deployed to constantly analyze data from your existing clients portfolios to find new opportunities and assign values for each of your prospects. its important to diversify your portfolio to make sure you are investing in the right technologies and companies. ai can help diversity portfolios by finding new investment opportunities akkio helps asset managers learn which customers are more likely to invest in particular categories based on their previous investments and demographic information as well as information like their risk appetite. ai can even be used to automate investment analysis by ingesting financial data from sources like a securities market to predict the probability of stock prices rising or falling. these predictions can then provide realtime strategy recommendations for individuals or institutional investors. the result a successful asset management strategy that attracts new clients and captures a greater share of existing client assets at the same time. further algorithms have been used in stock trading for decades. for example a 1986 new york times article titled wall streets tomorrow machine discussed the use of computers for evaluating new trading opportunities. todays ai trading is a form of automated trading that uses algorithms to find patterns in the market and make trades. ai traders can also be used to optimize portfolios with respect to risk and return objectives and are often used in trading organizations. aipowered trading systems can also use sentiment analysis to identify trading opportunities in the securities market. sophisticated ai algorithms can find buy and sell signals based on the tone of social media posts. a blockchain is a decentralized database that stores information in blocks of data. the blocks are linked together through cryptography to create a history of all transactions. the system relies on consensus among the users of the network about the validity of information and data making blockchains more secure than other types of databases. however as blockchain technology becomes more popular security threats are also increasing. larger blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum are practically impossible to attack due to the sheer amount of resources required. that said there are hundreds of smaller blockchains at risk. mit technology review reports  marketing slogans and headlines that called the technology unhackable were dead wrong as blockchains can be rewritten if an attacker is able to muster over 51 of the computational power defending a network allowing the attacker to reallocate ownership of funds. one such example is when ethereum classic a fork off of ethereum suffered a 51 attack 3 times in a single month . in 2020 there were over 120 blockchain attacks leading to losses to the tune of nearly 4 billion. while preventing 51 attacks depends on distributed participants allocating compute resources to chain defense users and exchanges need to be able to detect anomalous behavior when it happens on a chain so they can attempt to minimize loss of funds. akkios machine learning algorithms can detect anomalies in realtime alerting you and enabling you to take action quickly before additional damage is done. with akkios automl it only takes minutes to build a fraud detection system tailored to your needs. the pharmaceutical supply chain is notoriously fragile  leading to shortages higher costs and safety issues. part of these issues lie in underoptimized drug delivery systems. pharmaceutical firms spend millions of dollars shipping drug samples to doctors and hospitals. simple analyses uncover situations for order consolidation such as when the same location requests two or more drug samples. however manually looking at the data for order consolidation quickly becomes infeasible at scale. ai helps optimize supply chain delivery processes by predicting which orders can be consolidated no matter how complex or how many orders there are to process. thats the killer advantage of ai its incredibly fast and accurate compared to traditional techniques. ai can be used to find the best locations for consolidated shipping estimate cost savings and improve customer satisfaction. instead of putting out fires related to unoptimized supply chains health systems can now focus on what truly matters helping patients. in a world of virtually unlimited data and powerful analytics its easy to see why health systems are looking for ways to better understand the health of their patients. with ai platforms teams can connect to various data sources like lab results and hie and use machine learning models to predict the severity of a patients condition and what type of care they will need. medical professionals should consider screening patients that may have a higher likelihood for a particular disease. if they see a patient that could be predisposed to developing an illness treating them right away will lead to better health outcomes in addition to being more fiscally responsible than not seeing them until theyre carrying it. ultimately using ai to automate disease propensity modeling has the potential to save hospitals and other healthcare providers millions of dollars per year by reducing unnecessary emergency room visits and readmissions. staffing and budgeting for a hospital icu is always a difficult decision and its even harder when you dont know how quickly the patient load will change. with machine learning hospitals can easily make projections about their occupancy by modeling historic data to account for trends. exceeding capacity limits as has happened in icu rooms around the world as of late often results directly in patient death. higher occupancy rates are clearly correlated to higher death rates . with ai hospitals can quickly create a model that forecasts occupancy rates which consequently leads to more accurate budgeting and staffing decisions. machine learning models help hospitals save lives reduce staffing inefficiencies and better prepare for incoming patients. forecasting models also help hospitals make better decisions about what services they need to offer their patients. healthcare has been rapidly changing over the last few years with an increased focus on providing holistic care and individualized treatment plans. further forecasting can help hospitals anticipate patient needs and provide the right services to meet expectations. ultimately machine learning algorithms make it easy for hospitals to predict the next step in their operations and make more informed decisions about future staffing needs. the result is healthier happier patients and a stronger bottom line for hospitals. sepsis is a lifethreatening condition that can develop suddenly and with devastating consequences. it is a leading cause of death in intensive care units and in hospital settings and the incidence of sepsis is on the rise . doctors and nurses are constantly challenged by the need to quickly assess patient risk for developing sepsis which can be difficult when symptoms are nonspecific. decades ago sepsis wasnt much of a concern. today sepsis accounts for almost a fifth of human deaths. ai complements medical professionals expertise by providing datadriven insights to identify patients at high risk for developing sepsis. medical professionals can leverage the power of machine learning to aggregate patient data and generate automated alerts tailored to each patients unique needs. machine learning models are designed to learn from historical data which can include past sepsis cases to provide accurate predictions enabling healthcare professionals to confidently identify patients at high risk for developing sepsis. the average cost of a hospital readmission ranges from 15000 to 25000  which leads to wasted resources unnecessary tests potentially harmful treatments delayed patient care and other damaging consequences. machine learning can help in reducing readmission risk via predictive analytics models that identify atrisk patients. by feeding in historical hospital discharge data demographics diagnosis codes and other factors medical professionals can calculate the probability that the patient will have a readmission. ai makes it easy for hospitals to identify which patients are most atrisk for readmissions. nocode ai tools dont require any it work or coding so hospitals can save money and improve the quality of care they provide. ultimately ais hospital readmission risk usecase can help hospitals reduce their costs and increase the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients. terrorism is a top concern for intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. after 911 preventing terrorist attacks became a heavilyfunded prime directive for a number of government agencies. as described in a united nations office of counterterrorism report on ai  government agencies can use predictive modeling to identify red flags of radicalization detect the spread of terrorist misinformation and counter terrorist narratives. machine learning isnt just for marketing it can also be used to help prevent terror attacks by identifying patterns in past events and predicting future ones saving lives and making the world a safer place. fraud is an issue that is costly not only to the government and its citizens but to companies as well. every government agency from the irs to the social security administration suffers significant losses from fraud. in fact as explored in an association of certified fraud examiners report  a study of nearly 3000 cases of occupational fraud found that government entities were the most represented sectors among the fraud cases analyzed. while much public discourse centers around governments as perpetrators of fraud the reality is often that government employees and agencies are often the targets of a widerange of fraudulent activities. fraudulent activities can be difficult to detect costing agencies valuable time and resources. ultimately ai makes it easy for government agencies to detect fraudulent activities as they happen saving them time and resources while also safeguarding taxpayer dollars. in the age of digital transformation attack vectors are getting ever larger. as a result even government agencies are at risk of being breached by insiders or exemployees who want to use their data for malicious purposes. at the same time there are a number of insider threats that can seem innocuous in nature but costly nonetheless such as sending company information over a personal account or even accidentally misconfiguring access credentials. for example while cybersecurity firms like to keep their exact techniques private research shows that ai can accurately identify malicious emails which cost governments billions of dollars if undetected. to make sure that firms dont have to pay for these kinds of internal breaches agencies need to proactively block any potential misuse using machine learning to identify risks. cyberattacks are on the rise with realworld consequences for everyday people. recently for instance hackers stopped gasoline and jet fuel pipelines and closed off beef and pork production at a leading us supplier. these are just a couple of examples of the tens of thousands of annual cybersecurity attacks. one of the main challenges in cybersecurity today is an evergrowing attack vector. as more and more of our world goes digital theres more data to keep track of and its easier for hackers to go unnoticed. manually combing through this data can only get you so far but ai can scan massive amounts of data in realtime. nocode ai enables security teams to build deploy and refresh models to predict incoming threats in realtime whether its scanning incoming emails for malicious threats or flagging concerning ip activity so they can prevent a breach before it happens. ultimately this enables security teams to reduce their risk exposure and prepare for an increasingly hostile cyber landscape. teams that fail to deploy ai for cybersecurity will be more vulnerable to attacks compared to other market players who do. good customer service is of universal importance with surveys indicating that 96 of customers feel customer service is important in their choice of loyalty to a brand. customer service is also a major factor in customer retention. in other words people are more likely to stay with a company if theyre satisfied with the service they receive. aibased classification of customer support tickets can help companies respond to queries in an efficient manner. by combining natural language processing and machine learning ai can be used to automatically group queries into predefined categories making it easy for customer support teams to select the appropriate department to handle a query based on their area of expertise. essentially by digesting past queries to find patterns in terms of content ai can learn how to classify new tickets more accurately and efficiently. this means that with time aibased ticket classification will become an integral part of any organizations customer service strategy. customer support teams need to handle a huge number of customer queries in a limited time and theyre often not sure which tickets need to be addressed first. machine learning models can rank tickets according to their urgency with the most urgent tickets addressed first. this relieves teams of the burden of deciding which tickets require the most attention freeing up more time for actually addressing tickets and satisfying customers. predictive analytics is also useful for identifying patterns in the data so that customer queries can be more accurately met with answers and it allows teams to improve their customer experience by responding faster. social media is an invaluable tool for marketing and customer support teams but its a complicated and fastmoving landscape. every day millions of people post their thoughts opinions and suggestions to social media about brands theyre interacting with. from a raving comment to a scathing review social media posts can have a big impact on your companys success. machine learning can help teams make sense of the vast amount of social media data by automatically classifying the sentiment of posts in realtime thanks to models trained on historical data. this enables teams to respond faster and more effectively to customer feedback. ultimately this allows marketers and customer service teams to identify early warning signs of dissatisfaction before they spiral out of control and needlessly drive away customers. in the process of data entry we know that errors will be made. humans are not perfect and this includes those who code the data editing mistakes can occur such as inverting an s or a z in the input document. it is reasonable to assume that there may be multiple copies of your records in which different people may have typed one letter wrong or did not notice inconsistent formatting such as smith versus smith before saving it as a new version. additionally data can be brought in by multiple systems with different column values such that duplicates wont be found by traditional means e.g. one system has the first and last name while another system has their email. detecting duplicates is notoriously difficult requiring manual intervention to identify duplicate records. this can be timeconsuming and prone to human error. ai is different its fully automated and can detect duplicates for all types of fields with high accuracy. ai is essential for complex deduplication tasks because the same record could show up multiple times throughout your database. with ai you can detect these duplicates even if they have different data fields  making it easy to clean up your database so that it adheres to best practices without any manual intervention. lead scoring is a powerful way to determine which leads are most in need of your attention. ai enables teams to automatically predict the likelihood that each lead will become a paying customer. armed with these insights marketing teams can decide which leads to pursue and spend time on and which to put on the backburner. todays lead scoring is powered by machine learning that leverages any historical data whether from salesforce snowflake google sheets or any other source to predict the likelihood a given lead will convert. this insight helps marketing teams to identify leads that are in need of more attention as well as those that are likely to be a waste of time for the team. as a business forecasting is one of your most important tasks. its what allows you to plan ahead and make better use of your budget. machine learning can help you do that with unparalleled accuracy even in unpredictable economic environments. nocode ai can be used to quickly build a model from past sales data and predict the sales youre likely to receive in the future. with nocode ai you can get accurate forecasts in a matter of seconds by uploading your product catalog and past sales data. instead of relying on rules of thumb or gut feelings ai offers a more scientific approach that lets you make better decisions about your budget staff hiring and promotional campaigns. this is essential for businesses that need to know how to budget for the future or optimize their limited resources. forecasting models can be deployed through a webbased interface api salesforce or even through zapier making it easy to get started in any setting without requiring any data science knowhow. the way we consume goods has changed. in the past we would go to the store pick out what we needed and purchase it. nowadays we can order what we need from the comfort of our own home and have it delivered to our door. as a result the way we are marketed to has changed. direct marketing is an excellent way for businesses to reach their potential customers and its a largely underutilized opportunity. that said its often difficult to determine which prospects are the most likely to purchase. marketing to uninterested leads isnt just a waste of time and money  it can be a huge turnoff to those leads from ever deciding to make a purchase decision. ai can find the best prospects among a particular group and determine the best way to reach them. this means you can quickly and easily identify the most valuable leads and then contact them with a personalized message that speaks to their particular needs. with nocode ai you can effortlessly prioritize and classify leads based on their likelihood of converting all at a fraction of the time and cost that traditional methods require. a loyalty program is a reward program that gives points or other awards to customers who shop at a particular establishment. a typical example might be a program that provides each customer with ten points for every dollar spent at the store and if a customer collects 1000 points they are given 10 off their purchase. loyalty programs are designed to incentivize customers to shop with the company on a regular basis and they usually consist of various tiers of rewards depending on how much the customer spends each time. the most effective type of loyalty program is one that provides increased benefits based on the amount of money spent as customers are more likely to be motivated by the prospect of an increased reward. unfortunately even if you have a good understanding of your customers behaviors and preferences it is not easy to predict which rewards will incentivize them most effectively. while your neighborhood coffee shop might offer a free coffee for every fifth visit the scale and complexity of loyalty programs are orders of magnitude greater for large datadriven firms. machine learning algorithms can analyze past data and detect which customer segments are most likely to respond positively to certain rewards. this helps managers make informed decisions about which rewards to offer and when increasing the likelihood that they will convert. one of the best ways that marketers can create a personalized experience for customers is by considering the next best offer. this requires marketers to take into account all of the possible actions they could take with that customer and then select the most appropriate one. as an example suppose that a customer visits a website for information on renting. the customer cant decide between a studio or onebedroom apartment so she searches for more information on both and cannot find any definitive information. in this case the next best offer could be to create a personalized email with links to articles and videos from both types of apartments so the customer can decide which one is better for her. doing this manually is clearly impossible at scale. businesses can use ai to offer the right product to the right person at the right time. businesses can automatically make recommendations in realtime using predictive models that account for customer preferences price sensitivity and product availability or any data provided for training. predicting the right offer for the right person at the right time is a huge undertaking but ai makes it easy for retailers to optimize their operations. best of all retailers dont need any data scientists or ai specialists to deploy predictive models  nocode ai automatically powers recommendations with no coding required. if your marketing budget includes advertising on social media the web tv and more it can be difficult to tell which channels are most responsible for driving sales. with machine learningdriven attribution modeling teams can quickly and easily identify which marketing activities are driving the most revenue. marketing attribution models are traditionally built through largescale statistical analysis which is timeconsuming and expensive. nocode ai platforms can build accurate attribution models in just seconds and nontechnical teams can deploy the models in any setting. this lets marketing teams keep costs down while still pinpointing exactly where to allocate their marketing budget to optimize for the best roi. ultimately this makes it easier to ensure that every dollar spent on marketing is worth it so youre consistently getting the most out of your marketing budget. by automating attribution marketers can overcome the boring stuff and get more creative with what really matters. armed with knowledge on how specific channels are performing marketers can finally doubledown on highperforming channels eliminate the laggards and strategize how to move forward. consumers today expect personalized products and content. machine learning enables businesses to finally target consumers with the right message at the right time and on the right channel. for example rather than using one message to reach everyone on your website machine learning could be used for sentiment analysis of customer reviews on your site or your crm or social media tools to present different customer segments with different messages. in addition ai platforms can be trained on historical product purchase data to build a product recommendations model. for example if a customer has purchased a certain product in the past an ai api can be deployed to recommend related products that the customer is likely to be interested in. this can be a powerful propellant for the bottom line as research shows that 80 of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences. beyond personalized experiences ai can even be used for personalizing products and services themselves. while today many of these individualized products are created by an individual designer or a custom order personalized ai will make this process much more efficient tailoring the product to an individual customers needs and delivering it in a matter of days. the churn rate also known as the rate of attrition is the number of customers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. for a company to grow it must acquire more new customers than its churn rate. its quite a challenge to prevent customer churn which is why its so important for companies to be proactive. fortunately ai has the power to do just that. machine learning algorithms can identify the data patterns common among customers who are likely to churn such as those with a high cost of acquisition or those that are misaligned with your ideal customer persona. armed with this knowledge you can optimize your retention strategy by targeting highrisk customers with personalized offers or incentives before they leave. moreover marketing teams can tailor their strategies to avoid highchurnprofile leads. the more data you have the better. ai platforms like akkio allow you to work with your data sources wherever they are  your crm system data warehouses and other databases  to create the best model for predicting churn for your business. when it comes to marketing there are always more tactics to explore than time or resources allow. trying to decide which channel or activity to focus on that will have the biggest impact on revenue means youre forced to make guesses. ai can put those guesses to the test. machine learning algorithms can be fed with data from all of your marketing channels as well as customer lifecycle information to identify which activities are most likely to move each individual customer closer to purchase. ab testing is a great way to figure out how best to allocate marketing resources but only if you can measure success accurately. thats where machine learning excels its able not only to measure and predict sales but also predict what might happen if you try any given marketing tactic. google adwords is a huge part of most advertising budgets but it can be difficult to get bidding right. if you bid too low you lose out on opportunities. if you bid too high your marketing roi will dwindle. however machine learning can make this process easier by building a model off of past marketing and sales activities to predict the sales volume attributable to each adword making it easy to determine the optimal price to bid to achieve your target roi while avoiding losing the word to a competitor. it is incredibly difficult and timeconsuming for teams to build auction models that can capture complex human behavior. but nocode ai can be used to build accurate models with just a few clicks. companies can deploy these models easily with an api in any setting or even with nocode tools like zapier. ultimately this enables marketing teams to boost the effectiveness of their ad spend which is critical for success in an evermore competitive landscape for consumer attention. teams that fail to deploy ai for adwords bidding will lose directly to their competitors that are using datadriven strategies. lead scoring is a crucial part of any marketing campaign because it helps you focus your time and resources on the potential customers that are most likely to become paying customers. in other words an accurate lead scoring model helps you go where the money is. in fact over twothirds of marketers point to lead scoring as a top revenue contributor. accurate lead scoring can be tough though. its not easy to measure how well a customer will interact with your product without knowing much about them so traditional lead scoring models rely on interest from the prospect to determine the score. traditional approaches are highly limited since they dont necessarily indicate the prospects ability or true probability of making a purchase. thats where ai comes in. machine learning models use a wide range of factors to score marketing leads. with datadriven lead scoring models you can have more confidence in your marketing decisions because youre looking at more data points than just interest from the prospect. studies have shown that attracting and retaining top talent is one of the most important factors in a companys success. after all the average employee exit costs an entire third of their annual salary. however as employeeemployer relationships are shifting the challenge of getting and keeping top talent is getting tougher. year after year employee attrition is increasing and some are calling this crisis  the great resignation . but theres hope data. nocode ai platforms let hr professionals scan massive amounts of data  from hiring pipelines to employee history or performance reviews  to uncover insights to keep your best people working for your team. with nocode ai you can use machine learning algorithms to create predictive models that let you predict when an employee might be considering a job change when they might be considering leaving their current position or if theyre simply unsatisfied. this datadriven approach illuminates potential issues before they become major problems giving hr teams the highquality insights they need for more informed decisionmaking. with tools like zapier hr teams can even deploy predictive models in any setting without writing code. for many machine learning might as well be magic. but the truth is as weve seen that its really just advanced statistics empowered by the growth of data and more powerful computers. having said that machine learning models are incredibly versatile tools that can add tremendous value across business units. we saw earlier for example how finance teams can use machine learning to predict fraud  marketing teams can score leads or predict churn  hr teams can predict attrition  and more. building the machine learning models to make these usecases possible was once an arduous resourceintensive task requiring technical experts for data engineering building pipelines coding maintaining infrastructure and more. as weve explored nocode ai allows anyone to create and deploy machine learning models on their own without needing programming skills. however to become truly aidriven getting ai to work for you is not a onetime upgrade. it is a journey that will require an understanding of data management and the use of machine learning. another reason that codebased ai is problematic is that there is a shortage of programmers and the shortfall is expected to grow as the ai industry grows. as acm reports  theres actually a recent decrease in computer science graduates in spite of increasing demand for them fueled by delays in student visa processing limited access to educational loans and travel embargos. as weve seen data is the fuel that powers machine learning engines which is why data preparation is so important when building a model. the expression the more the merrier holds true in machine learning which typically performs better with larger highquality datasets. with akkio you can connect this data from a number of sources such as a csv file an excel sheet or from snowflake a data warehouse or salesforce a customer relationship manager. for example suppose youd like to use ai to score sales leads . if your business uses salesforce you can directly connect your sales dataset and then select a column that relates to whether or not a deal was closed. many smaller sales teams keep it simple using google sheets or excel to organize lead data. both of these sources can be easily connected to akkio as well and youd build the model in the same wayby selecting the column youd like to predict. on the other end of the spectrum some larger firms use snowflake for handling massive amounts of sales data which can be easily integrated with akkio as well. weve explored how machine learning models are mathematical algorithms that are used to find patterns in data. to train a machine learning model you need a highquality dataset that is representative of the problem youre trying to solve. lets walk through a practical example. in akkio you can train a model by hitting add step once a dataset is connected and then predict. then simply select the column to predict. generally speaking there are two kinds of models you can train classification models and regression models. a few examples of classification include fraud prediction lead conversion prediction and churn prediction. the output values of these examples are all yes or no or similar such classes. on the other hand regression models are used to predict a range of output variables such as sales revenue or costs. after selecting predict training either kind of model is the same youll select the column name you want to predict whether its called conversion churn attrition fraud or any other metric. you also have the option to select a training mode which ranges from 10 seconds of training time to 5 minutes where longer training times may lead to more accurate models. while the training process is done in just a couple clicks a lot of work is done in the background. it starts with software engineering to lay the groundwork for the platform itself. software engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design development operation and maintenance of software. most of todays software development activities are performed by a team of engineers. but thats not all. devops is used to help bring ai applications to production. devops is a software development method that focuses on the collaboration between software developers and other it professionals. it aims to shorten the time between the softwares conception and its adoption by end users. in order to build the ai pattern recognition models themselves a number of different approaches are used. pattern recognition is the ability to identify a pattern in data and match that pattern in new data. this is a key part of machine learning and it can be either supervised or unsupervised. the bayesian approach to ai is a probabilistic approach to making decisions. bayesian methods are used to estimate the probability of a hypothesis based on prior knowledge and new evidence. another technique is dimensionality reduction a process that reduces the number of dimensions of a dataset by identifying which are important and removing those that are not. kmeans clustering and pca or principle component analysis are two methods commonly used together. in order to group associated data points kmeans finds the partition in data while pca finds the cluster membership vector. random forest is another common method. a random forest is a machine learning method that generates multiple decision trees on the same input features. the hierarchy of decision trees is built by randomly selecting observations to root each tree. gradient descent is a commonly used technique in various model training methods. its used to find the local minimum in a function through an iterative process of descending the gradient of error. these ai methods are often built with tools like tensorflow onnx and pytorch. tensorflow is an opensource software library for machine intelligence that provides a set of tools for data scientists and machine learning engineers to build and train neural nets. it is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. onnx is an opensource modeling language for neural networks that was created to make it easier for ai developers to transfer their algorithms between systems and applications. this opensource ai framework was made to be widely available to anyone who wants to use it. pytorch is an open source machine learning library for python based on torch. pytorch provides gpu acceleration and can be used either as a command line tool or through jupyter notebooks. pytorch has been designed with a pythonfirst approach allowing researchers to prototype models quickly. all of these model training processes are iterative and many technical model training considerations are accounted for. one of these concerns is overfitting which happens when a model tries to predict every individual input that it might get instead of just being able to predict certain patterns in the data. there are best practices that can be followed when training machine learning models in order to prevent these mistakes from happening. one of these best practices is regularization which helps with overfitting by shrinking parameters e.g. weights until they make less impact on predictions. an additional best practice for successful training is using cross validation. another concern is called the curse of dimensionality. this happens when the number of inputs to a model gets too large for it to work properly especially if many inputs are not statistically relevant to the outcome being predicted. a way to get around this is by simplifying or reducing the number of features or dimensions being used in order to make more accurate predictions  this is known as dimensionality reduction. one technique for dimensionality reduction is called principal component analysis or pca. pca turns a large amount of data into a few categories that are most useful for describing the properties of what youre measuring. not all machine learning models are made equal. theres a popular saying in the ai world garbage in garbage out. if lowquality data is used to build a machine learning model then the model will generate lowquality predictions as well. there are a number of metrics you can use to evaluate the performance of a model. after making any model in akkio you get a model report including a prediction quality section. if youve built a classification model the quality metrics include percentage accuracy precision recall and f1 score as well as the number of values predicted correctly and incorrectly for each class. because forecasting is used to predict a range of values as opposed to a limited set of classes there are different evaluation metrics to consider. after building a forecasting model such as for cost modeling youll see an rmse value and a field called usually within. rmse stands for root mean square error which is the standard deviation of the residuals prediction errors. the usually within field provides values that are simpler to understand in context such as a cost model thats usually within 40 of the actual value. venturebeat reports that 87 machine learning models never make it into production. this is affirmed by a separate study indicating that just 14.6 of firms have deployed ai capabilities in production. we cant blame them. ai is a difficult task and many companies try to reinvent the wheel by building their own data pipelines model infrastructure and more. at the same time a mckinsey survey found that just 8 of respondents engaged in effective scaling practices. what this means is that many firms are building models but are unable to deploy them particularly at scale. with akkio businesses can effortlessly deploy models at scale in a range of environments. more technical users can use our api to serve predictions in practically any setting while business users can deploy predictions directly in salesforce snowflake google sheets and thousands of other apps with the power of zapier. the term api is short for application programming interface and its a way for software to talk to other software. apis are often used in cloud computing and iot applications to connect systems services and devices. by querying akkios api endpoints businesses can send data to any model and get a prediction back in the form of a json data structure. for context data structures refer to the way data is organized in a computer program. data structures are built on two concepts data types and data manipulation. data types define the type of data in the structure such as number word or image. data manipulation defines how data is organized in the structure such as linear hierarchical or tree. models can even be deployed via web app to instantly get a url to share with others. when you hit deploy for a web app youll also get an iframe embed an inline frame which is an html tag that can be embedded in any site. users who deploy models can take advantage of cloud storage that scales to accommodate unlimited data uploads. ai is the next growth engine for cloud storage with a massive annual growth rate. further these cloud servers are home to huge graphical processing unit gpu clusters. ai algorithms that require a lot of mathematical calculations such as neural networks are well suited to gpu processing such that cloud servers enable unlimited scalability of model predictions. the importance of continuous learning in machine learning cannot be overstated. continuous learning is the process of improving a systems performance by updating the system as new data becomes available. continuous learning is the key to creating machine learning models that will be used years down the road. the process of updating a system with new data or learning is something that is done by people all the time. continuous learning seeks to replicate this process in a machine. the key to building robust models that continue to be valuable in the future is to learn from new information as it becomes available. this would allow the machine to adjust its behavior accordingly when responding to new information just like humans do. the more data a machine has the more effective it will be at responding to new information. the extent to which continuous learning is applied will help determine how intelligent the system is and how well it responds to new situations. machine learning operations mlops is the compendium of services and tools that an organization uses to help train and deploy machine learning models. mlops services help businesses and developers to get started with ai with service offerings that include data preparation model training hyperparameter tuning model deployment and ongoing monitoring and maintenance. organizations with a large training pipeline need mlops to efficiently scale training and production operations. these services allow developers to tap into the power of ai without having to invest as much in the infrastructure and expertise that are required to build ai systems. with akkio machine learning operations are standardized streamlined and automated in the background allowing nontechnical users to have access to the same caliber of features as industry experts. to recap data preparation is the process of transforming raw data into a format that is appropriate for modeling which makes it a key component of machine learning operations. this process typically includes splitting the data into parts for training and validation and normalizing the data. this means randomly splitting the data into a set of two subsets known as training data and testing data this is called stratified sampling. the first subset is then trained to try and find patterns in the data but the model doesnt know whats coming next. the second subset is used as new input the ai has never seen before which helps better predict outcomes. that way when you create predictions on new inputs using this model theyre more accurate because youre using examples that have not already been seen by the model. data preparation can also include normalizing values within one column so that each value falls between 0 and 1 or belongs to a particular range of values a process known as binning. for example if someone were providing demographic information about people who visit their website and are able to purchase goods online it would be helpful to split them into male or female under 18 or over 18 years old and so on in order to classify their behavior while browsing based on these groupings. the training phase is where machine learning models are generated out of algorithms. the algorithm may determine which features of the data are most predictive for the desired outcome. this phase can be divided into several substeps including feature selection model training and hyperparameter optimization. the goal of feature selection is to find a subset of features that still captures variability in the data while excluding those features that are irrelevant or have a weak correlation with the desired outcome. machine learning algorithms are supported by inferential statistics to train the model such that it is able to make inferences about new data. machine learning will often operate via a feedback loop whereby input data starts with an empty algorithm which then finds patterns in that data over the course of multiple iterations. that information is fed back into the algorithm which modifies its parameters and goes through another iteration for refinement until the optimal model is found. finally hyperparameter optimization determines what set of hyperparameter settings should be used based on some criteria such as cost or computational efficiency. factors to consider when evaluating model hyperparameter tunings can include the process of deploying an ai model is often the most difficult step of mlops which explains why so many ai models are built but not deployed. there are a number of different considerations to plan for including how will data be queried what product or service will the ai model be embedded into how do we ensure that all pieces of the model will continue to work together as expected over time these are just some of many questions which must be addressed before deployment. with akkio teams can deploy models without having to worry about these considerations and can select their deployment environment in clicks. nowadays there are many creative ways to deploy ai. for instance you can deploy models on mobile phones with limited bandwidth or even offlinecapable ai servers. offline ai is a model deployment option that can be used to serve predictions locally or at the edge for usecases like smart cctvs that might be in a wireless dead zone or even aipowered medical diagnostic apps that deal with sensitive health data. building and deploying any type of ai model can seem daunting but with nocode ai tools like akkio its truly effortless. as long as teams have the data which can come from tools like salesforce snowflake or even just a google sheets file they can effortlessly train and deploy intelligent models for everything from churn prediction to sales funnel optimization.,21183
https://medium.com/@amitvsolutions/machine-learning-101-the-complete-beginners-guide-to-machine-learning-686a30cbcf6b,machine learning 101 the complete beginners guide to machine learning  by amit verma  medium,machine learning is transforming every industry  from saving lives to increasing profits  making businesses smarter and society better. goal of ai is to give cognitive skills to machines  the ability to see hear speak read understand decide  just like humans. ai  goal to build machines with humanlike intelligence. machine learning is a subfield of ai that allows machines to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. instead of hardcoding rules we give the machine data  algorithms  and it finds the rules itself. the era of computation 1940s1960s  computers were born to calculate what humans couldnt compute fast enough. the era of data  storage 1970s2000s  as information exploded we needed computers to remember and manage our data. the era of intelligence 2010spresent  today we need machines that can see speak listen think  and act intelligently. these problems are not just about numbers  they require perception learning decisionmaking  i.e. cognitive skills . data is the solution and data is the key. we can generate insights and patterns from data to solve realworld problems. data generation is currently skyrocketing. with availability of so much data its finally possible to build predictive models that can study and analyze complex data to find useful insight and deliver more accurate results. we use patterns in data to understand whats happening  why its happening  and what might happen next  so we can take the right actions . machine learning is the process  the methodology we use to train a machine to learn from data and become capable of making decisions on its own. machine learning improves decision making uncover pattern and trends in data and performs computation on data. the machine learning process involves building a predictive model that can be used to find a solution for a problem statement. before jumping into code or data you need to clearly define what problem youre trying to solve . example in an ecommerce company we want to predict whether a customer will cancel an order based on their past behavior and current order details. predictive variable a.k.a. feature independent variable these are the inputs  the variables that you feed into the model to make a prediction. they are also called features or explanatory variables . response variable a.k.a. target dependent variable this is the output you want to predict. its the goal of the prediction task. output target variable order canceled yes or no. clearly identifying the response variable helps you define the ml problem type  what kind of data is needed to solve the problem collect the data that might help solve the problem. this could be from databases logs sensors files or apis. if available from where i can get this data how can i get this data download data or web scrapping example from your order cancellation problem gather a customer profiles b order history c product data d time of order edelivery location f feedback or complaints. note  data can be structured tables semistructured json or unstructured text images. raw data is messy this step ensures your data is clean complete and usable . data cleaning involves getting rid of inconsistencies in data such as missing values or redundant values. tasks include 1handling missing values 2removing duplicates 3encoding categorical variables e.g. male female  0 1 4normalizing or scaling numbers and 5creating features from raw columns e.g. extracting day of week from a timestamp. example  if some orders have no delivery location you can data exploration involves understanding the patterns and trends in data. at this stage all the useful insight are drawn and correlations between the variables are understood. correlation simply means how strongly does one variable move increase or decrease when another variable changes understand your data using visuals and statistics . this helps you example 1 use plots like histograms scatter plots box plots. 2correlation heatmaps to see how features relate to the output and 3you might find that most canceled orders happen in remote locations or during holidays goal gain insights to improve model performance and decide which features matter. at this stage a predictive models is built by using ml algorithms such as linear regression decision trees etc. choose an ml algorithm split your data into training and testing sets  and use the training data to create a model . example algorithm logistic regression for yesno prediction. in this stage we split our dataset into two parts in this customer order example output is based on categorical variable i.e. either order cancelled or not cancelled. in this case we use classification algorithm. evaluate how well your model performs on unseen data. the efficiency of the model is evaluated and any further improvements in the model are implemented. key metrics  accuracy precision  recall for imbalance f1 score and aucroc. the testing dataset is used to check the efficiency of the model and how accurately it can predict the outcome. example  your model has 92 accuracy  sounds good. but precision  60 and recall  40 not good for fraud detection or healthcare. tune it. further improvement in the model are done by using techniques like crossvalidation hyperparameter tuning grid search random search and feature selection. now your trained model is ready to predict on new realworld data  make it available as a service or embed it in an app. example when a new customer places an order your deployed model predicts there is a 72 chance the order will be canceled  flag it for manual review. you can retrain the model regularly with fresh data  this is model lifecycle management . supervised learning is a technique in which we train or teach the machine using data which is well labelled. semisupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train artificial intelligence ai models. unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is unlabeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without any guidance. realworld example customer segmentation in ecommerce reinforcement learning is a part of machine learning where an agent is put in an environment and he learns to behave in this environment by performing certain actions and observing the rewards which it gets from those actions. selfsupervised learning ssl is a machine learning paradigm where models learn from unlabeled data by automatically generating their own labels or supervisory signals. instead of relying on manually labeled datasets ssl algorithms define pretext tasks that allow the model to learn meaningful representations of the data by inferring relationships or patterns within the unlabeled input.  start with data  define the objective  choose the learning type  select the algorithm  train the model  use it for predictionsdecisions. all machine learning problems are grouped into three major types based on what kind of question youre trying to answer  and that defines how the model will learn and predict . question being asked how much what is the number realworld example predict house prices. question being asked which category does it belong to realworld example spam email detection. question being asked what are the natural groups or segments realworld example customer segmentation in marketing. all the problems which you gave to your machine learning model will fall into one of these categories. in machine learning once your data and problem are defined the next big decision is how to build the model . there are three main types of models that you can use  and each is trained using one or more of the five learning types supervised  unsupervised  semisupervised  reinforcement  and selfsupervised learning . these are models that have already been trained on massive datasets by researchers or companies. they are trained on general tasks like predicting the next word or filling in blanks and can be used directly for many common problems. this means you take a pretrained model and then train it further on your own labeled dataset . this process adapts the general intelligence of the model to your specific use case. in some cases you may want to build a model entirely from the ground up using your own algorithms and data. the ultimate goal of machine learning is not just to create a model  but to solve realworld problems intelligently efficiently and at scale. machine learning can solve a wide range of complex datadriven problems that are hard or impossible to solve using traditional programming machine learning is transforming every industry  from saving lives to increasing profits  making businesses smarter and society better. everything begins with the dream of building intelligent machines  systems that can see read listen speak and make decisions like humans. but how do we make machines intelligent  thats where machine learning ml steps in. it provides a way to train machines to learn from data and improve over time  without being explicitly programmed for every rule. start with data realworld examples records or observations  this is the foundation. define your objective and choose a learning type decide what kind of learning fits your problem choose the right algorithm based on the learning type and data select the best algorithm e.g. decision trees svm kmeans transformers. train or create your model feed your data into the algorithm to train a model  this model captures patterns and knowledge from the data. use the trained model now the model can answer questions make predictions generate content detect fraud drive cars and much more enjoy the intelligence whether its chatgpt answering questions spotify recommending songs or selfdriving cars navigating roads  its all powered by trained models. data  learning type  algorithm  model  predictions  intelligence unlocked the resul t your model is now intelligent  it can predict classify recommend or generate output. the outcome  your machine becomes a smart system  achieving artificial intelligence through machine learning. httpsdataflair.trainingblogsmachinelearningtutorial httpsdataflair.trainingblogsmachinelearningapplications,1626

https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/deep-learning/,what is deep learning  deep learning ai explained  aws,deep learning is an artificial intelligence ai method that teaches computers to process data in a way inspired by the human brain. deep learning models can recognize complex pictures text sounds and other data patterns to produce accurate insights and predictions. you can use deep learning methods to automate tasks that typically require human intelligence such as describing images or transcribing a sound file into text. deep generative learning is deep learning that focuses on creating new output from learned input. traditionally deep learning focused on identifying relationships between data. deep learning models were trained with large amounts of data to recognize patterns in the data set. deep generative learning adds generation to pattern recognition. such models look for data patterns and then create their own unique patterns. for example they can analyze the text in several books and then use the information to generate new sentences and paragraphs not found in the original books. deep generative learning is the basis of modern generative ai and foundation models . these models use deep learning technologies at scale trained on vast data to perform complex tasks like answering questions creating images from text and writing content. deep learning technology drives many artificial intelligence applications used in everyday products such as the following it is also a critical component of technologies like selfdriving cars virtual reality and more. businesses use deep learning models to analyze data and make predictions in various applications. deep learning has several use cases in automotive aerospace manufacturing electronics medical research and other fields. these various use cases of deep learning can be grouped into five broad categories computer vision speech recognition natural language processing nlp recommendation engines and generative ai. computer vision automatically extracts information and insights from images and videos. deep learning techniques to comprehend images in the same way that humans do. computer vision has several applications such as the following deep learning models can analyze human speech despite varying speech patterns pitch tone language and accent. virtual assistants such as amazon alexa texttospeech  and speechtotext software use speech recognition to do the following tasks computers use deep learning algorithms to gather insights and meaning from text data and documents. this ability to process natural humancreated text has several use cases including applications can use deep learning methods to track user activity and develop personalized recommendations . they can analyze users behavior and help them discover new products or services. for example generative ai applications can create new content and communicate with end users more sophisticatedly. they can assist in automating complex workflows brainstorming ideas and intelligent knowledge searches. for example with generative ai tools like amazon q business and amazon q developer  users can deep learning models are neural networks designed after the human brain. a human brain contains millions of interconnected biological neurons that work together to learn and process information. similarly artificial neurons are software modules called nodes that use mathematical calculations to process data. deep learning neural networks or artificial neural networks comprise many layers of artificial neurons that work together to solve complex problems. the components of a deep neural network are the following. an artificial neural network has several nodes that input data into it. these nodes make up the systems input layer. the input layer processes and passes the data to layers further in the neural network. these hidden layers process information at different levels adapting their behavior as they receive new information. deep learning networks have hundreds of hidden layers that they can use to analyze a problem from several different angles. for example if you were given an image of an unknown animal that you had to classify you would compare it with animals you already know. for example you would look at the shape of its eyes and ears size number of legs and fur pattern. you would try to identify patterns such as the following the hidden layers in deep neural networks work in the same way. if a deep learning algorithm tries to classify an animal image each of its hidden layers processes a different animal feature and tries to categorize it accurately. the output layer consists of the nodes that output the data. deep learning models that output yes or no answers have only two nodes in the output layer. on the other hand those that output a wider range of answers have more nodes. generative ai has a sophisticated output layer to generate new data that matches patterns in its training data set. the terms machine learning deep learning and generative ai indicate a progression in neural network technology. deep learning is a subset of machine learning . deep learning algorithms emerged to make traditional machine learning techniques more efficient. traditional machine learning methods require significant human effort to train the software. for example in animal image recognition you need to do the following this process is called supervised learning. in supervised learning result accuracy improves only with a broad and sufficiently varied dataset. for instance the algorithm might accurately identify black cats but not white cats because the training dataset had more images of black cats. in that case you would need more labeled data of white cat images to train the machine learning models again. a deep learning network has the following benefits over traditional machine learning. machine learning methods find unstructured data such as text documents challenging to process because the training dataset can have infinite variations. on the other hand deep learning models can comprehend unstructured data and make general observations without manual feature extraction. for instance a neural network can recognize that these two different input sentences have the same meaning a deep learning application can analyze large amounts of data more deeply and reveal new insights for which it might not have been trained. for example consider a deep learning model trained to analyze consumer purchases. the model has data only for the items you have already purchased. however the artificial neural network can suggest new items you havent bought by comparing your buying patterns to those of similar customers. deep learning models can learn and improve over time based on user behavior. they do not require large variations of labeled datasets. for example consider a neural network that automatically corrects or suggests words by analyzing your typing behavior. lets assume it was trained in english and can spellcheck english words. however if you frequently type nonenglish words such as danke the neural network automatically learns and autocorrects these words too. volatile datasets have large variations. one example is loan repayment amounts in a bank. a deep learning neural network can categorize and sort that data by analyzing financial transactions and flagging some for fraud detection. learn more about deep learning vs. machine learning generative ai took the neural networks of machine learning and deep learning to the next level. while machine learning and deep learning focus on prediction and pattern recognition generative ai produces unique outputs based on the patterns it detects. generative ai technology is built on transformer architecture that combines several different neural networks to combine data patterns in unique ways. deep learning networks first convert text images and other data into mathematical abstractions and then reconvert them into meaningful new patterns. challenges in implementing deep learning and generative ai are given below. when you train them on large amounts of highquality data deep learning algorithms give better results. outliers or mistakes in your input dataset can significantly affect the deep learning process. for instance in our animal image example the deep learning model might classify an airplane as a turtle if the dataset accidentally introduces nonanimal images. to avoid such inaccuracies you must clean and process large amounts of data before training deep learning models. the input data preprocessing requires large amounts of data storage capacity. deep learning algorithms are computeintensive and require infrastructure with sufficient compute capacity to function properly. otherwise they take a long time to process results. running generative ai and deep learning on cloud infrastructure helps you design develop and train applications faster. you can train generative ai and deep learning models faster by using clusters of gpus and cpus to perform the complex mathematical operations that your neural networks require. you can then deploy these models to process large amounts of data and produce increasingly relevant results. with the wide range of ondemand resources available through the cloud you can access virtually unlimited hardware resources to tackle ai deep learning models of any size. your neural networks can take advantage of multiple processors to seamlessly and efficiently distribute workloads across different processor types and quantities. you can access ai and deep learning tools like notebooks debuggers profilers pipelines aiops and more. you can work with existing generative ai models from within the cloud as a service without requiring infrastructure to host the model. teams can start with generative ai and deep learning applications even with limited knowledge and training. aws

https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide,seo starter guide the basics  google search central  documentation  google for developers,when you built your website you likely created it with your users in mind trying to make it easy for them to find and explore your content. one of those users is a search engine which helps people discover your content. seoshort for search engine optimizationis about helping search engines understand your content and helping users find your site and make a decision about whether they should visit your site through a search engine. the search essentials outline the most important elements of what makes your website eligible to appear on google search. while theres no guarantee that any particular site will be added to googles index sites that follow the search essentials are more likely to show up in googles search results . seo is about taking the next step and working on improving your sites presence in search . this guide will walk you through some of the most common and effective improvements you can do on your site. there are no secrets here thatll automatically rank your site first in google sorry. in fact some of the suggestions might not even apply to your business but following the best practices will hopefully make it easier for search engines not just google to crawl index and understand your content. google is a fully automated search engine that uses programs called crawlers to explore the web constantly looking for pages to add to our index. you usually dont need to do anything except publish your site on the web. in fact the vast majority of sites listed in our results are found and added automatically as we crawl the web. if youre hungry for more we have documentation about how google discovers crawls and serves web pages . every change you make will take some time to be reflected on googles end. some changes might take effect in a few hours others could take several months. in general you likely want to wait a few weeks to assess whether your work had beneficial effects in google search results. keep in mind that not all changes you make to your website will result in noticeable impact in search results if youre not satisfied with your results and your business strategies allow it try iterating with the changes and see if they make a difference. before you actually do anything mentioned in this section check if google has already found your content maybe you dont need to do anything. try searching on google for your site with the site search operator . if you see results pointing to your site youre in the index. for example a search for sitewikipedia.org returns these results . if you dont see your site check out the technical requirements to make sure theres nothing technically preventing your site from showing in google search and then come back here. google primarily finds pages through links from other pages it already crawled. in many cases these are other websites that are linking to your pages. other sites linking to you is something that happens naturally over time and you can also encourage people to discover your content by promoting your site . if youre open to a little technical challenge you could also submit a sitemap which is a file that contains all the urls on your site that you care about. some content management systems cms may even do this automatically for you. however this isnt required and you should first focus on making sure people know about your site . when google crawls a page it should ideally see the page the same way an average user does . for this google needs to be able to access the same resources as the users browser. if your site is hiding important components that make up your website like css and javascript  google might not be able to understand your pages which means they might not show up in search results or rank well for the terms youre targeting. if your pages have different information depending on the users physical location make sure youre satisfied with the information that google sees from its crawlers location which is generally the us. to check how google sees your page use the url inspection tool in search console . it might be important for you to opt out your site as a whole or sections of it from appearing in search results. for example you might not want your posts about your new embarrassing haircut to show up in search results. google supports various ways that lets you opt out of crawling and indexing of your urls. if you need to block some files directories or even your whole site from google search check out our guide about ways to prevent content from appearing in search results . when youre setting up or redoing your site it can be good to organize it in a logical way because it can help search engines and users understand how your pages relate to the rest of your site. dont drop everything and start reorganizing your site right now though while these suggestions can be helpful long term especially if youre working on a larger website search engines will likely understand your pages as they are right now regardless of how your site is organized. parts of the url can be displayed in search results as breadcrumbs so users can also use the urls to understand whether a result will be useful for them. google learns breadcrumbs automatically based on the words in the url but you can also influence them with structured data if you like a technical challenge. try to include words in the url that may be useful for users for example a url that only contains random identifiers is less helpful for users for example if you have more than a few thousand urls on your site how you organize your content may have effects on how google crawls and indexes your site. specifically using directories or folders to group similar topics can help google learn how often the urls in individual directories change. httpswww.example.compoliciesreturnpolicy.html the content in the policies directory seldomly changes however the content in the promotions directory likely changes very often. google can learn this information and crawl the different directories at different frequencies. to learn more about searchfriendly site structures check out our guide for ecommerce sites  for which a good url structure is more important as they tend to be larger. some websites show the same content under different urls which is called duplicate content . search engines choose a single url the canonical url to show users per piece of content. having duplicate content on your site is not a violation of our spam policies but it can be a bad user experience and search engines might waste crawling resources on urls that you dont even care about. if youre feeling adventurous its worth figuring out if you can specify a canonical version for your pages. but if you dont canonicalize your urls yourself google will try to automatically do it for you. when working on canonicalization try to ensure that each piece of content on your site is only accessible through one individual url having two pages that contain the same information about your promotions can be a confusing user experience for example people might wonder which is the right page and whether theres a difference between the two. if you have multiple pages that have the same information try setting up a redirect from nonpreferred urls to a url that best represents that information. if you cant redirect use the relcanonical link element instead. but again dont worry too much about this search engines can generally figure this out for you on their own most of the time. creating content that people find compelling and useful will likely influence your websites presence in search results more than any of the other suggestions in this guide. while compelling and useful content can mean different things to different people content like this generally shares some common attributes such as think about the words that a user might search for to find a piece of your content. users who know a lot about the topic might use different keywords in their search queries than someone who is new to the topic. for example some users might search for charcuterie while others might search for cheese board. anticipating these differences in search behavior and writing with your readers in mind could produce positive effects on how your site performs in search results. however dont worry if you dont anticipate every variation of how someone might seek your content. googles language matching systems are sophisticated and can understand how your page relates to many queries even if you dont explicitly use the exact terms in them. while ads are a part of the internet and are meant to be seen by users dont let them become overly distracting or prevent your users from reading your content. for example advertisements or interstitial pages pages displayed before or after the content youre expecting that make it difficult to use the website. links are a great way to connect your users and search engines to other parts of your site or relevant pages on other sites. in fact the vast majority of the new pages google finds every day are through links making links a crucial resource you need to consider to help your pages be discovered by google and potentially shown in search results. additionally links can also add value by connecting users and google to another resource that corroborates what youre writing about. link text also known as anchor text  is the text part of a link that you can see. this text tells users and google something about the page youre linking to. with appropriate anchor text  users and search engines can easily understand what your linked pages contain before they visit. links can provide more context on a topic both for users and search engines which may help demonstrate your knowledge on a topic. however when youre linking to pages outside of your control for example content on other sites make sure you trust the resource youre linking to. if you cant trust the content and you still want to link to them add a nofollow or similar annotation to the link to avoid search engines associating your site with the site youre linking to. this helps avoid potential negative consequences in your rankings in google search. if youre accepting usergenerated content on your site such as forum posts or comments make sure every link thats posted by users has a nofollow or similar annotation automatically added by your cms. since youre not creating the content in this case you likely dont want your site to be blindly associated with the sites users are linking to. this can also help discourage spammers from abusing your website. a typical google search results page consists of a few different visual elements that you can influence to help users decide whether they should visit your site through those search results. in this section were focusing on the title link and the snippet because these are the more visually significant elements. the title link is the headline part of the search result and it can help people decide which search result to click. there are a few sources that google uses to generate this title link including the words inside the title element also called the title text and other headings on the page. this title text can also be used for the title thats shown in browsers and bookmarks. you can influence the title links in search by writing good titles a good title is unique to the page clear and concise and accurately describes the contents of the page. for example your title could include the name of your website or business other bits of important information like the physical location of the business and maybe some information about what the particular page has to offer for users. our documentation about title links has more tips about how to create good titles and how to influence your sites search results title links. below the title link a search result typically has a description of the target page to help users decide whether they should click the search result. this is called a snippet . the snippet is sourced from the actual content of the page the search result is linking to thus you have complete control over the words that can be used to generate the snippet. occasionally the snippet may be sourced from the contents of the meta description tag which is typically a succinct one or twosentence summary of the page. a good meta description is short unique to one particular page and includes the most relevant points of the page. check out our tips for writing good meta descriptions for more inspiration. many people search visually and images can be how people find your website for the first time. for example if you have a recipe blog people might find your content by searching for fruit tart recipes and browsing photos of various types of fruit tarts. as you add images to your site make sure that people and search engines can find and understand them. when you use high quality images you give users enough context and detail to decide which image best matches what they were looking for. for example if people are looking for daisies and come across a rogue edelweiss in search results a higher quality image would help them distinguish the type of flower. use images that are sharp and clear and place them near text thats relevant to the image. the text thats near images can help google better understand what the image is about and what it means in context to your page. for example if the page is reviewing yarn shops in london then it would make sense to embed one of your photos of the yarn shop in the section that details the location description and review information for that yarn shop. this helps google and users associate the image with text that provides more context to what the page is about. alt text is a short but descriptive piece of text that explains the relationship between the image and your content. it helps search engines understand what your image is about and the context of how your image relates to your page so writing good alt text is quite important. you can add this to your html with the alt attribute of the img element or your cms may have an easy way to specify a description for an image when youre uploading it to your site. learn more about how to write good alt text  and how to add it to your images. if your website includes pages that are primarily about individual videos people may also be able to discover your site through video results in google search. many of the best practices for images and text also apply to videos if your site is particularly videofocused then continue reading about more things you can do to optimize your videos for search engines . effectively promoting your new content will lead to faster discovery by those who are interested in the same subject and also by search engines. you can do this in many ways one of the most effective and lasting ways is word of mouth that is people familiar with your site tell their friends about it who in turn visit your site. this can take time and usually you need to invest some time and effort in other practices first such as community engagement. our friends over at google for creators have excellent resources about building and engaging your audience . putting effort into the offline promotion of your company or site can also be rewarding. for example if you have a business site make sure its url is listed on your business cards letterhead posters and other materials. with their permission you could also send out recurring newsletters to your audience letting them know about new content on your website. as with everything in life you can overdo promoting your site and actually harm it people may get fatigued of your promotions and search engines may perceive some of the practices as manipulation of search results . as seo has evolved so have the ideas and practices and at times misconceptions related to it. what was considered best practice or top priority in the past may no longer be relevant or effective due to the way search engines and the internet have developed over time. to help you focus on the things that are actually important when it comes to seo we collected some of the most common and prominent topics weve seen circulating the internet. in general our message on these topics is that you should do whats best for your business area we will elaborate on a few specific points here when picking the name of your site do whats best for your business. users will use this name to find you so we recommend following general marketing best practices. from a ranking perspective the keywords in the name of the domain or url path alone have hardly any effect beyond appearing in breadcrumbs . and while still on the topic of domain names the tld the domain name ending like .com or .guru only matters if youre targeting a specific countrys users and even then its usually a low impact signal. for example if youre trying to sell dutch cheese to people searching from switzerland it makes some sense both from business and seo point of view  to use a .ch domain name. otherwise google search doesnt care which tld youre using whether its a .com or .org or .asia. having your headings in semantic order is fantastic for screen readers but from google search perspective it doesnt matter if youre using them out of order. the web in general is not valid html so google search can rarely depend on semantic meanings hidden in the html specification. theres also no magical ideal amount of headings a given page should have. however if you think its too much then it probably is. as you embark on your seo journey here are some resources that can help you stay on top of changes and new resources we publish,3083

component of digital marketing is mobile marketing. in fact smartphone usage as a whole accounts for 69 of time spent consuming digital media in the u.s. while desktopbased digital media consumption makes up less than half  and the u.s. still isnt mobiles biggest fan compared to other countries. this means optimizing your digital ads web pages social media images and other digital assets for mobile devices is essential. if your company has a mobile app that enables users to engage with your brand or shop for your products your app falls under the digital marketing umbrella too. those engaging with your company via mobile devices need to have the same positive experience as they would on a desktop. this means implementing a mobilefriendly or responsive website design with content hub to make browsing userfriendly on mobile devices. it might also mean reducing the length of your lead generation forms to create a hasslefree experience for people downloading your content on the go. as for your social media images its important to always have a mobile user in mind when creating them as image dimensions are smaller on mobile devices and text can be cut off. there are lots of ways you can optimize your digital marketing assets for mobile users and when implementing any digital marketing strategy its hugely important to consider how the experience will translate on mobile devices. by ensuring this is always frontofmind youll be creating digital experiences that work for your audience and consequently achieve the results youre hoping for. 7. conduct keyword research. digital marketing is all about reaching targeted audiences through personalized content  all of which cant happen without effective keyword research . conducting keyword research is critical for optimizing your website and content for seo and ensuring people can find your business through search engines. additionally social media keyword research can also help market your products or services on various social channels. youll still want to conduct keyword research even if you dont have a fulltime seo strategist. try creating a list of highperforming keywords related to your products or services and consider longtail variations for added opportunities. 8. iterate based on the analytics you measure. finally to create an effective digital marketing strategy for the long term its vital your team learn how to pivot based on analytics. for instance perhaps after a couple of months you find your audience isnt as interested in your content on instagram anymore  but they love what youre creating on x. sure this might be an opportunity to reexamine your instagram strategy as a whole but it might also be a sign that your audience prefers a different channel to consume branded content. alternatively perhaps you find an older web page isnt getting the traffic it used to. you might consider updating the page or getting rid of it entirely to ensure visitors are finding the freshest most relevant content for their needs. in any case having access to all of this data in the same place through platforms like hubspot analytics can be a godsend. you can track performance across multiple channels within easytodigest dashboards compare their results sidebyside and get all the data necessary to quickly spot new opportunities and adjust your strategy. interesting stat according

content for product pages. equipped with this guide and this seo checklist  youll be set up to rank your store and reap some seo rewards. ecommerce seo is the process of increasing the visibility of an online store in search engine results pages  serps . ecommerce websites use seo as a strategy to generate more traffic attracting visitors who input queries related to their products and brand. the tasks involved in ecommerce seo marketing are varied. for example creating optimized website content is one seo task you might undertake. your content could show up in relevant search results that catch the attention of new customers and guide them to purchase. for example an ecommerce store like true classic  which sells tshirts could improve its website seo by optimizing collection and product pages. as you begin the process of optimizing your online store the most essential ecommerce seo tasks to prioritize include other important tasks include speeding up page load time  crafting detailed product descriptions  and doing backlink outreach . after prioritizing these seo activities you can consider creating informational content to provide additional value and traffic sources. this informational content like blog posts or help center articles should target queries that a customer would likely ask before purchasing an item. true classic for example devotes an entire page to their different fabric options in detail so that shoppers can explore and get to know the products more deeply. when you search for something on google youre taken to a search engine results page serp. there youll find approximately 10 organic results  these organic results appear below paid ads orange and google shopping ads purple ecommerce seo is all about ensuring your product pages appear among the top organic search results on the first page of google. websites that dont rank within the top 10 are rarely visited and even those in positions three to five receive far less traffic than the top results.  worth noting seo company backlinko found that only 0.63 of searchers click on websites listed on page two of google search results. backlinko also reported that the first result on a google serp gets 27.6 of all the clicks in other words seo matters. the name of the game is to rank as high as possible on the first page of search engines like google and bingboth for search terms related to your products as well as searches within your ecommerce niche market . if youre new to search engine optimization and want to increase your stores ranking on google take a look at these six steps. they provide actionable tips for setting up good basic ecommerce seo on your website. the first step in any ecommerce seo strategy is to identify highvalue search terms that your potential customers are using. you can do that through ecommerce keyword research  which can be conducted in a number of ways. ecommerce keyword research is slightly different from traditional keyword research. while most sites care only about informational keywords youll want to target a mix of informational and commercial keywords like this informational keyword searchers are looking for answers guides and explanations. blogs and contentheavy sites care most about these keywords. many shopify stores and other ecommerce sites have blogs too but they also target keywords that show buying intent  like raincoats for dogs. when you start to type a search query into google its autocomplete feature suggests relevant queries these autocomplete suggestions can be a gold mine for keyword ideas especially when you already have a few basic keywords in mind. dont forget to check the related search queries at the bottom of the serp too. you can complete a similar process on amazon. the great thing about amazon suggestions is that unlike google theyre productfocused and can include filterable details such as price. pay particular attention to longtail keywords  which are longer and describe more specific items. the longer the keyword the more specific it is. that means lower competition and often higher conversion rates. you can also check how amazon and other major ecommerce sites structure content for visibility in search. take a look at relevant product menus for keyword category ideas. lets say you sell womens fashion items. if you find that category on amazon you can see all of the different ways amazon sorts and organizes its products in that niche repeat this process for any other major competitors. for more advanced keyword research youll need a free seo tool . the most popular is ahrefs . these tools provide the ability to research and analyze keywords en masse. lets say you compete with bustedtees  a geeky tshirt ecommerce store. enter its domain into a keyword research tool like ahrefs and click organic keywords at the top scroll down to see all the keywords bustedtees currently ranks for. youll also find metrics like search volume and rank position. with an overview of your competitors serp coverage you can make an informed decision about where to compete for keywords. no ecommerce website can target every keyword. based on your customers and products youll need to decide which keywords to try to rank for. head term keywords are very broad and usually very competitive. on the other hand long tail keywords are more specific and have less competition with usually a higher likelihood for conversion because of their relevance. the higher a keywords search volume  the more potential traffic to your site. you can discover keyword search volume using ahrefs or a free tool like google keyword planner . the lower the competition the more likely you are to rank for a keyword. seo tools will show you keyword difficultycompetition kd. how relevant is your product page or category page to the search term this is a huge ranking factor thats often neglected. stick to keywords that your products would genuinely satisfy. youre not foolin google and you shouldnt try to trick your customers either. target keywords that show an intent to buy or learn about a product. usually you can evaluate search intent just by looking at a keyword. for example if you own a bridal shop which search has the more relevant intent ball gown wedding dresses or work dresses its also wise to look at what other sites are currently ranking for a search term thatll help make sure your keyword usage has the same search intent. if you sell more than three of the same product type target relevant keywords with a collection. if you sell fewer than three of the same product type target keywords with each individual product page.  the ultimate keyword a high volume low competition term that aligns with the content on your website. once youve done your keyword research and your site structure is ready to rock its time to optimize the content on your two highestvalue page types if youre using shopify you likely know that shopify stores include several seo features. but other features require you to manually optimize your site when optimizing your title tags and descriptions note that these are googlefacing. the primary goal is ranking on the first page. the secondary goal is convincing searchers to click through to your site. modifiers like deals 20 off free shipping wide selection etc. can give you a boost when placed in the meta description or title if it fits and help you tackle longtail keywords. in ecommerce seo google and other search engines use the content on your page to decide which keywords to rank your page for and how high your page should rank for each keyword. if a product page has a short description and not much else google doesnt have much to go on. copying and pasting a description from a manufacturer or supplier is called duplicate content and is also advised against. instead write unique comprehensive product descriptions that capture readers interest and contain lots of details about your items. quality onpage content can help improve the ranking of your product pages and reduce overall thin content on your store. thats why in higherranking search results youll typically see product pages with longer descriptions reviews and more. try to include relevant keywords and subheadings in every section of your page to help google understand what your content refers to. if you cant create content for every product focus on those currently ranking on the bottom of the first page. boosting these results can have the biggest impact on conversions as they dont have as far to climb up in rankings. the more you write the more accurate google can be in ranking your page. your customers wont hate the extra product info eitherit might even help persuade them to buy. related keywords are exactly what they seem theyre similar to your main keyword. enter your keyword into google keyword planner to find related terms and phrases that you can pursue with your content. you can also find related keywords through an amazon search. look up your main keyword and check for secondary keywords that repeatedly appear. for example lets say youre trying to sell a blender. the terms 14 speed 450w and 48oz glass jar all appear multiple times indicating theyre strong selling factors and likely common elements of search terms. if youre getting traffic from a main keyword try to slide onto the first page for related secondary keywords as well. use related keywords in your content whenever they make sense. the longer you can keep your visitors browsing your content the more chance you have of making a sale. relevant internal links to other pages on your site help potential customers browse and discover information or products. in your anchor text the words that you place the internal link in make sure you include the target keyword verbatim. internal linking can be used to drive customers to relevant product pages category pages and educational content. dont get too wild with internal linking. one or two links every few hundred words is enough.  pro tip if you understand your audiences decisionmaking process you can develop content that helps them through the various stages in their buying journey . when it comes to seo ecommerce how the pages on your site are organized and structured affects your search engine rankings. site structure also impacts your user experience ux. you need to make it easy for visitors and search engines bots to navigate content in your store. as you add and remove products and categories site structure can get complicated. before you progress too far with developing your website ensure simplicity is underrated. you dont want to have visitors relying on the back button to get around your site running in circles trying to find what theyre looking for. you also dont want to have to reorganize and rearrange your site structure every time you add a new product category. most of your seo link authority is on your homepage because thats the most common page other businesses link to when referring to your website. so the more clicks away from your homepage a product page is the less authority it has. as you implement seo on your website youll want to make strategic choices about which webpages you choose to index and rank. index is another name for the database used by a search engine. so to index a page is to have it added to that database. in other words google has discovered your page and added it to its search results for advice on page indexing take a look at these tips from aleyda solis founder of seo consultancy orainti  aleyda recommends identifying which page types are worth indexing and optimizing. those pages should fulfill a real audience demand. one of the most common issues for ecommerce sites is thin content as well as content duplication aleyda says. thin content is the idea that theres not much actual text on an ecommerce site compared to say a blog or software site. content duplication occurs when the same content appears on multiple product and category pages. adding blog content to your online stores website is a good way to help counter thin content. the easiest way to handle content duplication is to hide a page from search engines  known as noindexing. however you can also create useful content for those pages to make them different relevant and competitive. you can also canonicalize pages. canonicalizing a page is a way of telling google that a url is the master version youd like to display in search results. this is helpful in duplicate content situations because without canonical tags google might  good to know if youre using shopify autogenerated canonical tags are added to pages to prevent duplicate content from appearing in search results. aleyda suggests going beyond noindex or

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization,search engine optimization  wikipedia,search engine optimization  seo  is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines .  1   2  seo targets unpaid search traffic usually referred to as  organic  results rather than direct traffic referral traffic social media traffic or paid traffic . organic search engine traffic originates from a variety of searches including image search  video search  academic search   3  news search industryspecific vertical search engines and large language models. as an internet marketing strategy seo considers how search engines work the algorithms that dictate search engine results what people search for the actual search queries or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by a target audience. seo helps websites attract more visitors from a search engine and rank higher within a search engine results page serp aiming to either convert the visitors or build brand awareness.  4  webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid1990s as the first search engines were cataloging the early web . search engine users would query the url of a page and then receive information found on the page if it existed in the search engines index . aliweb and the earliest versions of search engines required website developers to manually upload website index files in order to be searchable and widely did not utilize any form of ranking algorithm for user queries.  5  the emergence of automated web crawlers would later be used to proactively discover and index websites. this led to website developers to optimize their websites search signals including the use of meta tags  to achieve greater visibility in search results. according to a 2004 article by former industry analyst and current google employee danny sullivan  the phrase search engine optimization came into use in 1997. sullivan credits seo practitioner bruce clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.  6  in some cases early search algorithms weighted particular html attributes in ways that could be leveraged by web content providers to manipulate their search rankings.  7  as early as 1997 search engine providers began adjusting their algorithms to prevent these actions.  8  eventually search engines would incorporate more meaningful measures of page purpose including the more recent development of semantic search.  9  some search engines frequently sponsor seo conferences webchats and seminars. major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization.  10   11  google has a sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on google traffic to the website.  12  bing webmaster tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds allows users to determine the crawl rate and track the web pages index status. in 2015 it was reported that google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products resulting in brands and marketers shifting toward mobilefirst experiences.  13  in the 2020s the rise of generative ai tools such as chatgpt  claude perplexity and gemini gave rise to discussion around a concept variously referred to as generative engine optimization  answer engine optimization or artificial intelligence optimization . this approach focuses on optimizing content for inclusion

more promptable.  14  it has also been argued that each of these tactics should be considered as subsets of search experience optimization described by ahrefs as optimizing a brands presence for nonlinear search journeys over multiple platforms not just google.  15  in 1998 two graduate students at stanford university  larry page and sergey brin  developed backrub a search engine that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages. the number calculated by the algorithm pagerank  is a function of the quantity and strength of inbound links .  16  pagerank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web and follows links from one page to another. in effect this means that some links are stronger than others as a higher pagerank page is more likely to be reached by the random web surfer. page and brin founded google in 1998.  17  google attracted a loyal following among the growing number of internet users who liked its simple design.  18  offpage factors such as pagerank and hyperlink analysis were considered as well as onpage factors such as keyword frequency meta tags  headings links and site structure to enable google to avoid the kind of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered onpage factors for their rankings. although pagerank was more difficult to game  webmasters had already developed linkbuilding tools and schemes to influence the inktomi search engine and these methods proved similarly applicable to gaming pagerank. many sites focus on exchanging buying and selling links often on a massive scale. some of these schemes involved the creation of thousands of sites for the sole purpose of link spamming .  19  by 2004 search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation.  20  the leading search engines google bing  and yahoo  do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. some seo practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization and have shared their personal opinions.  21  patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines.  22  in 2005 google began personalizing search results for each user. depending on their history of previous searches google crafted results for logged in users.  23  in 2007 google announced a campaign against paid links that transfer pagerank.  24  on june 15 2009 google disclosed that they had taken measures to mitigate the effects of pagerank sculpting by use of the nofollow attribute on links. matt cutts  a wellknown software engineer at google announced that google bot would no longer treat any no follow links in the same way to prevent seo service providers from using nofollow for pagerank sculpting.  25  as a result of this change the usage of nofollow led to evaporation of pagerank. in order to avoid the above seo engineers developed alternative techniques that replace nofollowed tags with obfuscated javascript and thus permit pagerank sculpting. additionally several solutions have been suggested that include the usage of iframes  flash  and javascript.  26  in december 2009 google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results.  27  on june 8 2010 a new web indexing system called google caffeine was announced. designed to allow users to find news results forum posts and other content much sooner after publishing than before google caffeine was a change to the way google updated its index in order to make things show up quicker on google than before. according to carrie grimes the software engineer who announced caffeine for google caffeine provides 50 percent fresher results for web searches than our last index...  28  google instant  realtimesearch was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. with the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results.  29  google has implemented numerous algorithm updates to improve search quality including panda 2011 for content quality penguin 2012 for link spam hummingbird 2013 for natural language processing and bert 2019 for query understanding. these updates reflect the ongoing evolution of search technology and googles efforts to combat spam while improving user experience. on may 20 2025 google announced that ai mode would be released to all us users. ai mode uses what google calls a query fanout technique which breaks down the search query into multiple subtopics which generates additional search queries for the user.  30  the leading search engines such as google bing brave search and yahoo use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results. pages that are linked from other search engineindexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically. the yahoo directory and dmoz  two major directories which closed in 2014 and 2017 respectively both required manual submission and human editorial review.  31  google offers google search console  for which an xml sitemap feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found especially pages that are not discoverable by automatically following links  32  in addition to their url submission console.  33  yahoo formerly operated a paid submission service that guaranteed to crawl for a cost per click   34  however this practice was discontinued in 2009. search engine crawlers may look at a number of different factors when crawling a site. not every page is indexed by search engines. the distance of pages from the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get crawled.  35  mobile devices are used for the majority of google searches.  36  in november 2016 google announced a major change to the way they are crawling websites and started to make their index mobilefirst which means the mobile version of a given website becomes the starting point for what google includes in their index.  37  in may 2019 google updated the rendering engine of their crawler to be the latest version of chromium 74 at the time of the announcement. google indicated that they would regularly update the chromium rendering engine to the latest version.  38  in december 2019 google began updating the useragent string of their crawler to reflect the latest chrome version used by their rendering service. the delay was to allow webmasters time to update their code that responded to particular bot useragent strings. google ran evaluations and felt confident the impact would be minor.  39  to avoid undesirable content in the search indexes webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard robots.txt file in the root directory of the domain. additionally a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engines database by using a meta tag specific to robots usually meta namerobots contentnoindex . when a search engine visits a site the robots.txt located in the root directory is the first file crawled. the robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. as a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish to crawl. pages typically prevented from being crawled include loginspecific pages such as shopping carts and userspecific content such as search results from internal searches. in march 2007 google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam.  40  in 2020 google sunsetted the standard and opensourced their code and now treats it as a hint rather than a directive. to adequately ensure that pages are not indexed a pagelevel robots meta tag should be included.  41  a variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results. cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility. page design makes users trust a site and want to stay once they find it. when people bounce off a site it counts against the site and affects its credibility.  42  writing content that includes frequently searched keyword phrases so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic. updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. adding relevant keywords to a web pages metadata including the title tag and meta description  will tend to improve the relevancy of a sites search listings thus increasing traffic. url canonicalization of web pages accessible via multiple urls using the canonical link element  43  or via 301 redirects can help make sure links to different versions of the url all count towards the pages link popularity score. these are known as incoming links which point to the url and can count towards the page links popularity score impacting the credibility of a website.  42  seo techniques can be classified into two broad categories techniques that search engine companies recommend white hat and those techniques of which search engines do not approve black hat. search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter among them spamdexing . industry commentators have classified these methods and the practitioners who employ them as either white hat seo or black hat seo.  44  white hats tend to produce results that last a long time whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.  45  an seo technique is considered a white hat if it conforms to the search engines guidelines and involves no deception. as the search engine guidelines  10   11   46  are not written as a series of rules or commandments this is an important distinction to note. white hat seo is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. white hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users not for search engines and then making that content easily accessible to the online algorithms rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. white hat seo has been compared to web development that promotes accessibility  47  although the two are not identical. black hat seo attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines or involve deception. one black hat technique uses hidden text either as text colored similar to the background in an invisible div  or positioned offscreen. another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine a technique known as cloaking . another category sometimes used is grey hat seo . this is in between the black hat and white hat approaches where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. grey hat seo is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings.  citation needed  search engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines algorithms or by a manual site review. one example was the february 2006 google removal of both bmw germany and ricoh germany for the use of deceptive practices.  48  both companies subsequently apologized fixed the offending pages and were restored to googles search engine results page.  49  companies that employ black hat techniques or other spammy tactics can get their client websites banned from the search results. in 2005 the wall street journal reported on a company traffic power  which allegedly used highrisk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients.  50  wired magazine reported that the same company sued blogger and seo aaron wall for writing about the ban.  51  googles matt cutts later confirmed that google had banned traffic power and some of its clients.  52  seo is one approach within digital marketing alongside other strategies such as payperclick advertising and social media marketing. search engine marketing sem is the practice of designing running and optimizing search engine ad campaigns. its difference from seo is most simply depicted as the difference between paid and unpaid priority ranking in search results. sem focuses on prominence more so than relevance website developers should regard sem with the utmost importance with consideration to visibility as most navigate to the primary listings of their search.  53  a successful internet marketing campaign may also depend upon building highquality web pages to engage and persuade internet users setting up analytics programs to enable site owners to measure results and improving a sites conversion rate .  54   55  in november 2015 google released a full 160page version of its search quality rating guidelines to the public  56  which revealed a shift in their focus towards usefulness and mobile local search . in recent years the mobile market has exploded overtaking the use of desktops as shown in by statcounter in october 2016 where they analyzed 2.5 million websites and found that 51.3 of the pages were loaded by a mobile device.  57  google has been one of the companies that are utilizing the popularity of mobile usage by encouraging websites to use their google search console  the mobilefriendly test which allows companies to measure up their website to the search engine results and determine how userfriendly their websites are. the closer the keywords are together their ranking will improve based on key terms.  42  seo may generate an adequate return on investment . however search engines are not paid for organic search traffic their algorithms change and there are no guarantees of continued referrals. due to this lack of guarantee and uncertainty a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors.  58  search engines can change their algorithms impacting a websites search engine ranking possibly resulting in a serious loss of traffic. according to googles ceo eric schmidt  in 2010 google made over 500 algorithm changes  almost 1.5 per day.  59  industry analysts note that websites may face risks from algorithm changes that can significantly impact organic traffic. in addition to accessibility in terms of web crawlers addressed above user web accessibility has become increasingly important for seo. optimization techniques are highly tuned to the dominant search engines in the target market. the search engines market shares vary from market to market as does competition. google has maintained dominant market share in most regions with varying percentages by market.  60  in markets outside the united states googles share is often larger and data showed google was the dominant search engine worldwide as of 2007.  61  as of 2006 google had an 8590 market share in germany.  62  as of march 2024 google still had a significant market share of 89.85 in germany.  63  as of march 2024 googles market share in the uk was 93.61.  64  successful search engine optimization seo for international markets requires more than just translating web pages. it may also involve registering a domain name with a countrycode toplevel domain cctld or a relevant toplevel domain tld for the target market choosing web hosting with a local ip address or server and using a content delivery network cdn to improve website speed and performance globally. it is also important to understand the local culture so that the content feels relevant to the audience. this includes conducting keyword research for each market using hreflang tags to target the right languages and building local backlinks. however the core seo principlessuch as creating highquality content improving user experience and building linksremain the same regardless of language or region.  62  regional search engines have a strong presence in specific markets by the early 2000s businesses recognized that the web and search engines could help them reach global audiences. as a result the need for multilingual seo emerged.  69  in the early years of international seo development simple translation was seen as sufficient. however over time it became clear that localization and transcreationadapting content to local language culture and emotional resonancewere more effective than basic translation.  70  on october 17 2002 searchking filed suit in the united states district court  western district of oklahoma against the search engine google. searchkings claim was that googles tactics to prevent spamdexing constituted a tortious interference with contractual relations. on may 27 2003 the court granted googles motion to dismiss the complaint because searchking failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  71   72  in march 2006 kinderstart filed a lawsuit against google over search engine rankings. kinderstarts website was removed from googles index prior to the lawsuit and the amount of traffic to the site dropped by 70. on march 16 2007 the united states district court for the northern district of california  san jose division dismissed kinderstarts complaint without leave to amend and partially granted googles motion for rule 11 sanctions against kinderstarts attorney requiring him to pay part of googles legal expenses.  73   74 ,3467
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization,search engine optimization  simple english wikipedia the free encyclopedia,search engine optimization seo is about making websites and other forms of online presence appear higher in search results when someone searches for a term.  1  the search term is called a keyword .  2  the results of the search are displayed in the search engine s results pages serps such as those given by google  bing yahoo and others. other terms used to describe search engine optimization are internet marketing and search engine marketing.  3  seo is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when it ranks higher on the serp. these visitors can then be converted into customers. the process is often broken down into several core areas. onpage seo refers to the practice of optimizing elements on the website itself. this includes  4   5  technical seo refers to noncontent elements of a site that affect its performance and crawlability. key aspects include everything seorelated that doesnt take place on a website is considered offpage seo. among other things backlinks  social media and local citations are all aspects of offpage seo. seo is a crucial part of marketing campaigns run by businesses to reach customers online. companies hire seo agencies to do the work for them because of the expertise required.  7  if an seo method is approved by search engines to rank their website it is called a  white hat technique . if the method is not approved it is called a black hat technique. search engines penalize sites using black hat techniques by ranking them lower or by not showing them on search results at all.  8  however some techniques fall in between these two categories known as  gray hat techniques . these methods are not explicitly approved by search engines but are not strictly prohibited either. while they may offer shortterm ranking benefits they carry the risk of penalties if search engine guidelines change. since the early 2020s the integration of large language models llms into search engines has created a fundamental shift leading to the emergence of a complementary discipline to traditional seo. this new field is sometimes referred to as generative engine optimization geo or answer engine optimization aeo. its primary goal is not to win a click from a list of links but to have a brands information or data used and cited within an aigenerated answer  9  . this scenario referral to a zeroclick result  the successful resolution of a web query when the user gets their desired result immediately this evolution impacts all core areas of optimization as a result modern seo is becoming a hybrid discipline requiring strategies for both traditional search rankings and visibility within generative ai answers.,445
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing,content marketing  wikipedia,content marketing is a form of marketing focused on creating publishing and distributing content for a targeted audience online.  1  it is often used in order to achieve the following business goals attract attention and generate leads expand their customer base generate or increase online sales increase brand awareness or credibility and engage a community of online users. content marketing attracts new customers by creating and sharing valuable free content as well as by helping companies create sustainable brand loyalty  providing valuable information to consumers and creating a willingness to purchase products from the company in the future.  2  content marketing starts with identifying the customers needs. after that the information can be presented in a variety of long form and short form formats including news video white papers  ebooks  infographics  email newsletters  case studies podcasts  howto guides question and answer articles photos blogs  etc.  3  examples of short form content include short blog posts and social media posts.  4  content marketing requires continuous delivery of large amounts of content preferably within a content marketing strategy.  5  traditional marketers have long used content to disseminate information about a brand and build its reputation . taking advantage of technological advances in transportation and communication business owners began applying content marketing techniques in the late 19th century. content marketing aims to attract and retain audiences by consistently creating and sharing valuable relevant and free content. during the golden age of tv between the 1940s and 1950s advertising took over the media. companies focused on sales rather than connecting with the public. there were few ventures into content marketing and not many prominent campaigns. during the baby boom era kelloggs began selling sugary cereal to children. with this change in business model came sociable animal mascots lively animated commercials and the back of the cereal box as a form of targeted content marketing. this represented a new approach to making a brand memorable with the audience.  11  in the 1990s everything changed for marketers. the arrival of computers and the internet made websites and blogs flourish and corporations found content marketing opportunities through email. ecommerce adaptations and digital distribution became the foundation of marketing strategy. the internet also helped content marketing become a mainstream form of marketing. traditional media such as newspapers magazines radio and tv started to lose their power in the marketplace. companies started to promote and sell their products digitally.  12  the phrase content marketing was used as early as 1996  13  when john f. oppedahl led a roundtable for journalists at the american society for newspaper editors. by the late 2000s when social networks such as facebook  twitter  and youtube were born online content marketing was accessible shareable and ondemand anytime worldwide. by 2014 forbes magazines website had written about the seven most popular ways companies use content marketing.  16  in it the columnist points out that by 2013 the use of content marketing had jumped across corporations from 60 a year or so before to 93  17  as part of their overall marketing strategy. despite the fact that 70 of organizations are creating more content only 21 of marketers think they are successful at tracking return on investment . today content marketing has become a powerful model for marketers. storytelling is part of it and they must convey the companies messages or goal to their desired audience without pushing them to just buy the product or service. the rise of content marketing has turned many traditional businesses into media publishing companies.  18  the rise of content marketing has also accelerated the growth of online platforms such as youtube  yelp  linkedin  tumblr  pinterest  and more. businesses actively curate their content on these platforms with hopes to expand their reach to new audiences. part of transitioning to a media publishing mindset requires a change in structure and process to create content at the speed of culture. marketing content production is transforming from an advertising agency model to a newsroom model according to one consultant.  25  metrics to determine the success of content marketing are often tied to the original goals of the campaign. for example for each of these goals a content marketer may measure the different engagement and conversion metrics businesses focused on expanding their reach to more customers will want to pay attention to the increase in the volume of visitors as well as the quality of those interactions. traditional measures of volume include the number of visitors to a page and number of emails collected while time spent on page and clickthrough to other pages photos are good indicators for engagement.  citation needed  businesses want to measure the impact that their messages have on consumers. brand health refers to the positive or negative feedback that a company gets. it also measures how important a brand is for consumers. with this companies want to find out if brand reputation influences their customers to make a purchase.  26  for businesses hoping to reach not only more  but also new  types of customers online they should pay attention to the demographics of new visitors as evidenced by cookies that can be installed different sources of traffic different online behaviors andor different buying habits of online visitors. businesses focused on increasing sales through content marketing should look at traditional ecommerce metrics including clickthroughrate from a productpage to checkout and completion rates at the checkout. altogether these form a conversion funnel. moreover to better understand customers buying habits they should look at other engagement metrics like time spent per page number of productpage visits per user and reengagement. refers to companies that want to analyze whether their social media campaigns are generating commentary among consumers. this helps them to come up with ways to improve their product and service. this involves high level of brand engagement and builds brand loyalty.  28  digital content marketing which is a management process uses digital products through different electronic channels to identify forecast and satisfy the necessity of the customers.  29  the supply chain of digital content marketing mainly consists of commercial stakeholders and enduser stakeholders which represent content providers and distributors and customers separately.  38  in this process distributors manage the interface between the publisher and the consumer then distributors could identify the content that consumers need through external channels and implement marketing strategies. for instance library and document supply agencies as intermediaries can deliver the digital content of ebooks and ejournal articles to the users according to their search results through the electronic channels. another example is when consumers pay for the acquisition of some mp3 downloads search engines can be used to identify different music providers and smart agents can be used by consumers to search for multiple music provider sites. in a word the digital content marketing process needs to be conducted at the business level and service experience level because when consumers are accessing digital content their own experience depends on the complex network of relationships in the content marketing channels such as websites and videos. the consumers interact directly with distributors in the big supply chain through various digital products which have an important role in meeting the requirements of the consumers. the design and user experience of these channels directly decides the success of digital content marketing.  29  electronic services refer to interactive network services.  39  in the electronic service the interaction between the customer and the organizations mainly through the network technology such as using email telephone online chat windows for communication. electronic services are different from traditional services and they are not affected by distance restrictions and opening hours. digital content marketing through electronic service is usually served together with other channels to achieve marketing purposes including facetoface postal and other remote services. information companies provide different messages and documents to customers who use multiple search engines on different sites and set up access rights for business groups. these are some channels of digital content marketing.  29 ,1320
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing,content marketing  simple english wikipedia the free encyclopedia,content marketing is creating and sharing useful information to attract and keep customers. it is a type of marketing that helps businesses by giving people helpful content instead of just trying to sell things directly. companies use this type of marketing to build trust and show they are experts in their field.  1  content marketing is different from traditional advertising. traditional advertising tries to sell products directly through ads commercials and sales messages. content marketing focuses on helping people by giving them useful information  entertainment  or education . instead of saying buy our product content marketing says here is some helpful tips to solve your pain point or achieve your goal.  2  content marketing works by attracting people who are interested in a topic related to a business. for example a cooking company might write blog posts about healthy recipes. people who read these posts might later buy the companys cooking products. the company builds trust by being helpful first then customers are more likely to buy from them.  3 ,170
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,machine learning  wikipedia,machine learning  ml  is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions .  1  within a subdiscipline in machine learning advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks  a class of statistical algorithms to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.  2  ml finds application in many fields including natural language processing  computer vision  speech recognition  email filtering  agriculture  and medicine . the application of ml to business problems is known as predictive analytics . statistics and mathematical optimisation mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. data mining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis eda via unsupervised learning .  4   5  from a theoretical viewpoint probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework. the term machine learning was coined in 1959 by arthur samuel  an ibm employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence .  6   7  the synonym selfteaching computers was also used in this time period.  8   9  the earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when arthur samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.  10  in 1949 canadian psychologist donald hebb published the book the organization of behavior  in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells .  11  hebbs model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how ais and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data.  10  other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician walter pitts and warren mcculloch  who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.  10  by the early 1960s an experimental learning machine with punched tape memory called cybertron had been developed by raytheon company to analyse sonar signals electrocardiograms  and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . it was repetitively trained by a human operatorteacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a  goof  button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.  12  a representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was nils nilsson s book on learning machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.  13  interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s as described by duda and hart in 1973.  14  in 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters 26 letters 10 digits and 4 special symbols from a computer terminal.  15  tom m. mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t  as measured by p  improves with experience e .  16  this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. this follows alan turing s proposal in his paper  computing machinery and intelligence  in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do.  17  modern day machine learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types supervised learning algorithms unsupervised learning algorithms and reinforcement learning algorithms.  18  in 2014 ian goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks gans with realistic data synthesis.  19  by 2016 alphago obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques.  20  shortly after transformer architectures obtained natural language processing powering the now popular large language models advancing generative ai and multimodal applications.  21  as a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence ai. in the early days of ai as an academic discipline  some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed  neural networks  these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics.  23  probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis .  24   488 however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning. probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.  24   488 by 1980 expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favour.  25  work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming ilp but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval .  24   708710 755 neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time. this line too was continued outside the aics field as  connectionism  by researchers from other disciplines including john hopfield  david rumelhart  and geoffrey hinton . their main success came in the mid1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation .  24   25 machine learning ml reorganised and recognised as its own field started to flourish in the 1990s. the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic  and probability theory .  25  there is a close connection between machine learning and compression. a system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution. conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history. this equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence.  26   27   28  an alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors  and compressionbased similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. for each compressor c. we define an associated vector space  such that c. maps an input string x corresponding to the vector norm x. an exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space instead feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods lzw lz77 and ppm.  29  according to aixi theory a connection more directly explained in hutter prize  the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. for example in that model a zip files compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software since you can not unzip it without both but there may be an even smaller combined form. examples of aipowered audiovideo compression software include nvidia maxine  aivc.  30  examples of software that can perform aipowered image compression include opencv  tensorflow  matlab s image processing toolbox ipt and highfidelity generative image compression.  31  in unsupervised machine learning  kmeans clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. this technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression .  32  data compression aims to reduce the size of data files enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. kmeans clustering an unsupervised machine learning algorithm is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters k each represented by the centroid of its points. this process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. particularly beneficial in image and signal processing  kmeans clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.  33  machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases. data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as  unsupervised learning  or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.  citation needed  machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation  many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples.  36  characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deep learning algorithms. machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample  while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns.  37  conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. in addition only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. in contrast machine learning is not built on a prestructured model rather the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. the more variables input used to train the model the more accurate the ultimate model will be.  38  leo breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model  39  wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest . some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning .  40  analytical and computational techniques derived from deeprooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to largescale problems including machine learning e.g. to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks .  41  statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics .  42  a core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience.  3   43  generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set. the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . for the best performance in the context of generalisation the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has under fitted the data. if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases. but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer.  44  in addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories which correspond to learning paradigms depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system although each algorithm has advantages and limitations no single algorithm works for all problems.  45   46   47  supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.  48  the data known as training data  consists of a set of training examples. each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal. in the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector  and the training data is represented by a matrix . through iterative optimisation of an objective function  supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.  49  an optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. an algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.  16  types of supervisedlearning algorithms include active learning  classification and regression .  50  classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. for example in a classification algorithm that filters emails the input is an incoming email and the output is the folder in which to file the email. in contrast regression is used for tasks such as predicting a persons height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data.  51  similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. it has applications in ranking  recommendation systems  visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification. unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled classified or categorised. instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering dimensionality reduction   5  and density estimation .  52  cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters  so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness  or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation  the difference between clusters. other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . a special type of unsupervised learning called selfsupervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.  53   54  semisupervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labelled training data and supervised learning with completely labelled training data. some of the training examples are missing training labels yet many machinelearning researchers have found that unlabelled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. in weakly supervised learning  the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets.  55  reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory  control theory  operations research  information theory  simulationbased optimisation  multiagent systems  swarm intelligence  statistics and genetic algorithms . in reinforcement learning the environment is typically represented as a markov decision process mdp. many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.  56  reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact models are infeasible. reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.  57  in other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features. most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis pca. pca involves changing higherdimensional data e.g. 3d to a smaller space e.g. 2d. the manifold hypothesis proposes that highdimensional data sets lie along lowdimensional manifolds  and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation . other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this threefold categorisation and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. for example topic modelling  metalearning .  58  selflearning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of selflearning named crossbar adaptive array caa.  59   60  it gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward by introducing emotion as an internal reward. emotion is used as state evaluation of a selflearning agent. the caa selflearning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations. the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.  61  the selflearning algorithm updates a memory matrix w was such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine it is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behaviour a. there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. the backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation. the caa exists in two environments one is the behavioural environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. after receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the caa learns a goalseeking behaviour in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.  62  several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.  63  classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions. this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown datagenerating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. this replaces manual feature engineering  and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. in supervised feature learning features are learned using labelled input data. examples include artificial neural networks  multilayer perceptrons  and supervised dictionary learning . in unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabelled input data. examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis  autoencoders  matrix factorisation  64  and various forms of clustering .  65   66   67  manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional. sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higherdimensional vectors.  68  deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features. it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.  69  feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. however realworld data such as images video and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms. sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix . the method is strongly nphard and difficult to solve approximately.  70  a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k svd algorithm. sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. in classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. for a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising . the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot.  71  in data mining  anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.  72  typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud  a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text. anomalies are referred to as outliers  novelties noise deviations and exceptions.  73  in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts of inactivity. this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the microclusters formed by these patterns.  74  three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.  75  unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection. semisupervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning  76   77  and finally metalearning e.g. maml. association rule learning is a rulebased machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness.  78  rulebased machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge. the defining characteristic of a rulebased machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. this is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.  79  rulebased machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems  association rule learning and artificial immune systems . based on the concept of strong rules rakesh agrawal  tomasz imieliski and arun swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in largescale transaction data recorded by pointofsale pos systems in supermarkets.  80  for example the rule  o n i o n s  p o t a t o e s    b u r g e r  displaystyle mathrm onionspotatoes rightarrow mathrm burger  found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . in addition to market basket analysis  association rules are employed today in application areas including web usage mining  intrusion detection  continuous production  and bioinformatics . in contrast with sequence mining  association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. learning classifier systems lcs are a family of rulebased machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm  with a learning component performing either supervised learning  reinforcement learning  or unsupervised learning . they seek to identify a set of contextdependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.  81  inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses. given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs . inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.  82   83   84  shapiro built their first implementation model inference system in 1981 a prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.  85  the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction  proving a property for all members of a wellordered set. a machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that once trained on a given dataset can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. during training a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the models internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions.  86  by extension the term model can refer to several levels of specificity from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.  87  various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems picking the best model for a task is called model selection . artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains . such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any taskspecific rules. an ann is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called  artificial neurons  which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another. an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. in common ann implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number  and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs. the connections between artificial neurons are called edges. artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. however over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology . artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision  speech recognition  machine translation  social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis . deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.  88  decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the items target value represented in the leaves. it is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning. tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers  are called regression trees. in decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making . in data mining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decisionmaking. random forest regression rfr falls under umbrella of decision treebased models . rfr is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. to build decision trees rfr uses bootstrapped sampling for instance each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set. this random selection of rfr for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy. rfr generates independent decision trees and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor tasks. this makes rfr compatible to be used in various applications.  89   90  supportvector machines svms also known as supportvector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.  91  an svm training algorithm is a non probabilistic  binary  linear classifier  although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting. in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using what is called the kernel trick  implicitly mapping their inputs into highdimensional feature spaces. regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. its most common form is linear regression  where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares . the latter is often extended by regularisation methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression . when dealing with nonlinear problems goto models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel  92   logistic regression often used in statistical classification  or even kernel regression  which introduces nonlinearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higherdimensional space. multivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. this approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. it is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images  93  which are inherently multidimensional. a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph dag. for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences  are called dynamic bayesian networks . generalisations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams . a gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution  and it relies on a predefined covariance function  or kernel that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. given a set of observed points or inputoutput examples the distribution of the unobserved output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new unobserved point. gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in bayesian optimisation used to do hyperparameter optimisation . a genetic algorithm ga is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection  using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. in machine learning genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.  95   96  conversely machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms .  97  the theory of belief functions also referred to as evidence theory or dempstershafer theory is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability  possibility and imprecise probability theories . these theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined e.g. dempsters rule of combination just like how in a pmf based bayesian approach would combine probabilities.  98  however there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification . these belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learners decision boundary  low samples and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.  99   7  however the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions classes and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches. rulebased machine learning rbml is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns rules from data. it provides interpretable models making it useful for decisionmaking in fields like healthcare fraud detection and cybersecurity. key rbml techniques includes learning classifier systems   100  association rule learning   101  artificial immune systems   102  and other similar models. these methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time. typically machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. when training a machine learning model machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text  a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service. overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. trained models derived from biased or nonevaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. biased models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams. federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralises the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. this also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. for example gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to google .  103  there are many applications for machine learning including in 2006 the mediaservices provider netflix held the first  netflix prize  competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10. a joint team made up of researchers from att labs research in collaboration with the teams big chaos and pragmatic theory built an ensemble model to win the grand prize in 2009 for 1 million.  107  shortly after the prize was awarded netflix realised that viewers ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns everything is a recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.  108  in 2010 an article in the wall street journal noted the use of machine learning by rebellion research to predict the 2008 financial crisis .  109  in 2012 cofounder of sun microsystems  vinod khosla  predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.  110  in 2014 it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists.  111  in 2019 springer nature published the first research book created using machine learning.  112  in 2020 machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for covid19.  113  machine learning was recently applied to predict the proenvironmental behaviour of travellers.  114  recently machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphones performance and thermal behaviour based on the users interaction with the phone.  115   116   117  when applied correctly machine learning algorithms mlas can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting . by employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts mlas can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like ols .  118  recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.  119  machine learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes.  120   121   122  other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.  123   124  although machine learning has been transformative in some fields machinelearning programs often fail to deliver expected results.  125   126   127  reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems.  128  the  black box theory  poses another yet significant challenge. black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data.  129  the house of lords select committee which claimed that such an intelligence system that could have a substantial impact on an individuals life would not be considered acceptable unless it provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it makes.  129  in 2018 a selfdriving car from uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision.  130  attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.  131   132  microsofts bing chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.  133  machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. while it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.  134  explainable ai xai or interpretable ai or explainable machine learning xml is artificial intelligence ai in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the ai.  135  it contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an ai arrived at a specific decision.  136  by refining the mental models of users of aipowered systems and dismantling their misconceptions xai promises to help users perform more effectively. xai may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.  137  learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson. a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.  138  a realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies.  139   140  adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from nonpattern perturbations. for some systems it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.  141  machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning .  142  researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying e.g. for categories spam and wellvisible not spam of posts machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of datasoftware transparency is provided possibly including whitebox access .  143   144   145  classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. in comparison the kfold crossvalidation method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining k1 subsets for training the model. in addition to the holdout and crossvalidation methods bootstrap  which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy.  146  in addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate tpr and true negative rate tnr respectively. similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate fpr as well as the false negative rate fnr. however these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. receiver operating characteristic roc along with the accompanying area under the roc curve auc offer additional tools for classification model assessment. higher auc is associated with a better performing model.  147  the ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within ai that are considered to have particular ethical stakes.  148  this includes algorithmic biases  fairness   149  automated decisionmaking   150  accountability  privacy  and regulation . it also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics how to make machines that behave ethically lethal autonomous weapon systems  arms race dynamics ai safety and alignment  technological unemployment  aienabled misinformation   151  how to treat certain ai systems if they have a moral status ai welfare and rights artificial superintelligence and existential risks .  148  different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. a machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. when trained on humanmade data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.  152  systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitising cultural prejudices.  153  for example in 1988 the uks commission for racial equality found that st. georges medical school had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have noneuropean sounding names.  152  using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.  154   155  another example includes predictive policing company geolitica s predictive algorithm that resulted in disproportionately high levels of overpolicing in lowincome and minority communities after being trained with historical crime data.  156  while responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of ai for machine learnings vulnerability to biases.  157  in fact according to research carried out by the computing research association cra in 2021 female faculty merely make up 16.1 of all faculty members who focus on ai among several universities around the world.  158  furthermore among the group of new u.s. resident ai phd graduates 45 identified as white 22.4 as asian 3.2 as hispanic and 2.4 as african american which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of ai.  158  language models learned from data have been shown to contain humanlike biases.  159   160  because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.  161   162  in 2016 microsoft tested tay  a chatbot that learned from twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.  163  in an experiment carried out by propublica  an investigative journalism organisation a machine learning algorithms insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants.  156  in 2015 google photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas which caused controversy. the gorilla label was subsequently removed and in 2023 it still cannot recognise gorillas.  164  similar issues with recognising nonwhite people have been found in many other systems.  165  because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.  166  concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including feifei li  who said that theres nothing artificial about ai. its inspired by people its created by people andmost importantlyit impacts people. it is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility.  167  there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the publics interest but as incomegenerating machines. this is especially true in the united states where there is a longstanding ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits. for example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithms proprietary owners hold stakes. there is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated.  168  since the 2010s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.  169  by 2019 graphics processing units  gpus  often with aispecific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training largescale commercial cloud ai.  170  openai estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet 2012 to alphazero 2017 and found a 300000fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doublingtime trendline of 3.4 months.  171   172  tensor processing units tpus are specialised hardware accelerators developed by google specifically for machine learning workloads. unlike generalpurpose gpus and fpgas  tpus are optimised for tensor computations making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. they are widely used in google cloud ai services and largescale machine learning models like googles deepmind alphafold and large language models. tpus leverage matrix multiplication units and highbandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency.  173  since their introduction in 2016 tpus have become a key component of ai infrastructure especially in cloudbased environments. neuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. these systems may be implemented through softwarebased simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures.  174  a physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials such as memristors to emulate the function of neural synapses . the term physical neural network highlights the use of physical hardware for computation as opposed to softwarebased implementations. it broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses.  175   176  embedded machine learning is a subfield of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers  edge devices and microcontrollers .  177   178   179   180  running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing thereby reducing the risk of data breaches privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property personal data and business secrets. embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques such as hardware acceleration   181   182  approximate computing   183  and model optimisation.  184   185  common optimisation techniques include pruning  quantisation  knowledge distillation  lowrank factorisation network architecture search and parameter sharing. software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following,8679
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,machine learning  simple english wikipedia the free encyclopedia,machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed  arthur samuel  1959.  1   2  it is a subfield of computer science .  3  the idea came from work in artificial intelligence .  4  machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms which can learn and make predictions on data .  5  such algorithms follow programmed instructions  but can also make predictions or decisions based on data.  6   2 they build a model from sample inputs. machine learning is done where designing and programming explicit algorithms cannot be done. examples include spam filtering  detection of artificial neural network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach  7  optical character recognition ocr  8  search engines and computer vision . using machine learning has risks. some algorithms create a final model which is a black box .  9  models have been criticized for biases in hiring  10  criminal justice  11  and recognizing faces.  12  learning algorithms try to predict what will happen in the future with patterns from the past. these predictions can be obvious for example if the sun rose for the past 10000 days it will probably rise again. these predictions can also be more complex. an example of a complex prediction is facial recognition knowing who someone is by looking at face. machine learning programs can do things that it hasnt been told to do by a programmer . machine learning programs will be shown some patterns. these patterns will be an input such as a question and an output the answer to the question. then the machine learning program will predict the output based on the input. machine learning isnt always necessary. computers can do simple tasks by being told instructions. however sometimes there are a lot of things that control the output. then it is hard for a human to tell the computer all of the instructions. it is sometimes easier to tell the computer how to teach itself.  13  there are a lot of different ways to tell the computer to teach itself. when a problem has a lot of answers different answers can be marked as valid. this is used to form data that the computer is trained with. one example of training data is the mnist data. the mnist data has images of handwritten numbers. the computer can learn to identify handwritten numbers using the mnist data.,397
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,artificial intelligence  wikipedia,artificial intelligence  ai  is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence  such as learning  reasoning  problemsolving  perception  and decisionmaking . it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.  1  highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines e.g. google search  recommendation systems used by youtube  amazon  and netflix  virtual assistants e.g. google assistant  siri  and alexa  autonomous vehicles e.g. waymo  generative and creative tools e.g. language models and ai art  and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games e.g. chess and go . however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore .  2   3  various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. the traditional goals of ai research include learning reasoning  knowledge representation  planning  natural language processing  perception  and support for robotics .  a  to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization  formal logic  artificial neural networks  and methods based on statistics  operations research  and economics .  b  ai also draws upon psychology  linguistics  philosophy  neuroscience  and other fields.  4  some companies such as openai  google deepmind and meta   5  aim to create artificial general intelligence agiai that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956  6  and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history   7   8  followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters .  9   10  funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques.  11  this growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture .  12  in the 2020s an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative ai became known as the ai boom . generative ais ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms which has raised ethical concerns about ais longterm effects and potential existential risks  prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems. these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research.  a  early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions .  13  by the late 1980s and 1990s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics .  14  many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow.  15  even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model. they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments.  16  accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. knowledge representation and knowledge engineering  17  allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts. formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval  18  scene interpretation  19  clinical decision support  20  knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases   21  and other areas.  22  a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.  23  knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects  24  situations events states and time  25  causes and effects  26  knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know  27  default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing  28  and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous  29  and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally.  16  there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition  the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications.  c  an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.  d   32  in automated planning  the agent has a specific goal.  33  in automated decisionmaking  the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid. the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the  utility  that measures how much the agent prefers it. for each possible action it can calculate the  expected utility  the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.  34  in classical planning  the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.  35  in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic. it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.  36  in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved. these can be learned e.g. with inverse reinforcement learning  or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.  37  information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.  38  the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. a policy associates a decision with each possible state. the policy could be calculated e.g. by iteration  be heuristic  or it can be learned.  39  game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents.  40  machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.  41  it has been a part of ai from the beginning.  e  there are several kinds of machine learning. unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.  44  supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input.  45  in reinforcement learning  the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good.  46  transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.  47  deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.  48  computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity  by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization .  49  natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages.  50  specific problems include speech recognition  speech synthesis  machine translation  information extraction  information retrieval and question answering .  51  early work based on noam chomsky s generative grammar and semantic networks  had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation  f  unless restricted to small domains called  microworlds  due to the common sense knowledge problem  29  . margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning  52  transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism  53  and others.  54  in 2019 generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text  55   56  and by 2023 these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam  sat test gre test and many other realworld applications.  57  machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar  sonar radar and tactile sensors  to deduce aspects of the world. computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.  58  the field includes speech recognition   59  image classification   60  facial recognition  object recognition   61  object tracking   62  and robotic perception .  63  affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood .  65  for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction . however this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.  66  moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis  wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.  67  a machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence .  68  ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.  b  ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.  69  there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search . state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.  70  for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis .  71  simple exhaustive searches  72  are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers . the result is a search that is too slow or never completes.  15   heuristics  or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.  73  adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go. it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position.  74  local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.  75  gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks   76  through the backpropagation algorithm. another type of local search is evolutionary computation  which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.  77  distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking  and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails .  78  formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation .  79  formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies  80  and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as  every x is a y  and there are some x s that are y s.  81  deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement  conclusion  from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises .  82  proofs can be structured as proof trees  in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . in the case of horn clauses  problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.  83  in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic  resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.  84  inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable  and therefore intractable . however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog  is turing complete . moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.  85  fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between 0 and 1. it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.  86  nonmonotonic logics  including logic programming with negation as failure  are designed to handle default reasoning .  28  other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. many problems in ai including reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.  87  precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory  decision analysis   88  and information value theory .  89  these tools include models such as markov decision processes   90  dynamic decision networks   91  game theory and mechanism design .  92  bayesian networks  93  are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm  g   95  learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm   h   97  planning using decision networks   98  and perception using dynamic bayesian networks .  91  probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time e.g. hidden markov models or kalman filters .  91  the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers e.g. if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers e.g. if diamond then pick up on the other hand. classifiers  99  are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . each pattern also called an  observation  is labeled with a certain predefined class. all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience.  45  there are many kinds of classifiers in use.  100  the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.  101  knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid1990s and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the 1990s.  102  the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner  103  at google due in part to its scalability.  104  neural networks are also used as classifiers.  105  an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons  which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer. a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.  105  learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.  106  neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. in theory a neural network can learn any function.  107  in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.  108  the term perceptron typically refers to a singlelayer neural network.  109  in contrast deep learning uses many layers.  110  recurrent neural networks rnns feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events. long shortterm memory networks lstms are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem .  111  convolutional neural networks cnns use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. this local processing is especially important in image processing  where the early cnn layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures and eventually whole objects.  112  deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs.  110  the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input. for example in image processing  lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces.  114  deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision  speech recognition  natural language processing  image classification   115  and others. the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.  116  the sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the 1950s  i  but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to gpus  and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as imagenet .  j  generative pretrained transformers gpt are large language models llms that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. textbased gpt models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the internet. the pretraining consists of predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation. throughout this pretraining gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token. typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf. current gpt models are prone to generating falsehoods called  hallucinations . these can be reduced with rlhf and quality data but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems.  124  such systems are used in chatbots  which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.  125   126  current models and services include chatgpt  claude  gemini  copilot  and meta ai .  127  multimodal gpt models can process different types of data  modalities  such as images videos sound and text.  128  in the late 2010s graphics processing units gpus that were increasingly designed with aispecific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit cpus as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training.  129  specialized programming languages such as prolog were used in early ai research  130  but generalpurpose programming languages like python have become predominant.  131  the transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 monthsa trend known as moores law  named after the intel cofounder gordon moore  who first identified it. improvements in gpus have been even faster  132  a trend sometimes called huangs law   133  named after nvidia cofounder and ceo jensen huang . ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s including search engines such as google search  targeting online advertisements  recommendation systems offered by netflix  youtube or amazon  driving internet traffic  targeted advertising  adsense  facebook  virtual assistants such as siri or alexa  autonomous vehicles including drones  adas and selfdriving cars  automatic language translation  microsoft translator  google translate  facial recognition  apple s faceid or microsoft s deepface and google s facenet  and image labeling used by facebook  apples photos and tiktok . the deployment of ai may be overseen by a chief automation officer cao. the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.  134  through the lens of the hippocratic oath  medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.  135   136  for medical research ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data . this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication.  137  it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.  137   138  new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. for example alphafold 2 2021 demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the 3d structure of a protein .  139  in 2023 it was reported that aiguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria.  140  in 2024 researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinsons disease drug treatments. their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises parkinsons disease. they were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold.  141   142  game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test ais most advanced techniques.  143  deep blue became the first computer chessplaying system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov  on 11 may 1997.  144  in 2011 in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm s question answering system  watson  defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings  by a significant margin.  145  in march 2016 alphago won 4 out of 5 games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol  becoming the first computer go playing system to beat a professional go player without handicaps . then in 2017 it defeated ke jie  who was the best go player in the world.  146  other programs handle imperfectinformation games such as the poker playing program pluribus .  147  deepmind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models such as with muzero  which could be trained to play chess go or atari games.  148  in 2019 deepminds alphastar achieved grandmaster level in starcraft ii  a particularly challenging realtime strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.  149  in 2021 an ai agent competed in a playstation gran turismo competition winning against four of the worlds best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.  150  in 2024 google deepmind introduced sima a type of ai capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen openworld video games by observing screen output as well as executing short specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.  151  large language models such as gpt4  gemini  claude  llama or mistral  are increasingly used in mathematics. these probabilistic models are versatile but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations . they sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised finetuning  152  or trained classifiers with humanannotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.  153  a february 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.  154  one technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps rather than just the correct result.  155  the alibaba group developed a version of its qwen models called qwen2math  that achieved stateoftheart performance on several mathematical benchmarks including 84 accuracy on the math dataset of competition mathematics problems.  156  in january 2025 microsoft proposed the technique rstarmath that leverages monte carlo tree search and stepbystep reasoning enabling a relatively small language model like qwen7b to solve 53 of the aime 2024 and 90 of the math benchmark problems.  157  alternatively dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as alphatensor  alphageometry  alphaproof and alphaevolve  158  all from google deepmind   159  llemma from eleutherai  160  or julius .  161  when natural language is used to describe mathematical problems converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as lean to define mathematical tasks. the experimental model gemini deep think accepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in the international math olympiad of 2025.  162  some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.  163  topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches. finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied ai tools are being deployed from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance where automated robot advisers have been in use for some years.  164  according to nicolas firzli director of the world pensions  investments forum  it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative aiinformed financial products and services. he argues that the deployment of ai tools will simply further automatise things destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking financial planning and pension advice in the process but im not sure it will unleash a new wave of e.g. sophisticated pension innovation.  165  various countries are deploying ai military applications.  166  the main applications enhance command and control  communications sensors integration and interoperability.  167  research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis logistics cyber operations information operations and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles .  166  ai technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors threat detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition  coordination and deconfliction of distributed joint fires between networked combat vehicles both humanoperated and autonomous .  167  ai has been used in military operations in iraq syria israel and ukraine.  166   168   169   170  generative artificial intelligence generative ai genai  171  or gai is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text images  videos  audio  software code or other forms of data.  172   173  these models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data  174   175  based on the input which often comes in the form of natural language prompts .  176   177  generative ai tools have become more common since the ai boom in the 2020s. this boom was made possible by improvements in transformer based deep neural networks  particularly large language models llms. major tools include chatbots such as chatgpt  copilot  gemini  claude  grok  and deepseek  texttoimage models such as stable diffusion  midjourney  and dalle  and texttovideo models such as veo and sora .  178   179   180  technology companies developing generative ai include openai  xai  anthropic  meta ai  microsoft  google  mistral ai  deepseek  baidu  181  and yandex .  182  ai agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment make decisions and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. these agents can interact with users their environment or other agents. ai agents are used in various applications including virtual assistants  chatbots  autonomous vehicles  gameplaying systems  and industrial robotics . ai agents operate within the constraints of their programming available computational resources and hardware limitations. this means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. in realworld applications ai agents often face time constraints for decisionmaking and action execution. many ai agents incorporate learning algorithms enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. using machine learning ai agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.  193   194   195  microsoft introduced copilot search in february 2023 under the name bing chat  as a builtin feature for microsoft edge and bing mobile app. copilot search provides aigenerated summaries  196  and stepbystep reasoning based of information from web publishers ranked in bing search.  197  for safety copilot uses aibased classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content.  198  google officially pushed its ai search at its google io event on 20 may 2025.  199  it keeps people looking at google instead of clicking on a search result. ai overviews uses gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content.  200  applications of ai in this domain include aienabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions  201  aiintegrated sex toys e.g. teledildonics   202  aigenerated sexual education content  203  and ai agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners e.g. replika .  204  ai is also used for the production of nonconsensual deepfake pornography  raising significant ethical and legal concerns.  205  ai technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online genderbased violence and online sexual grooming of minors.  206   207  there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. in a 2017 survey one in five companies reported having incorporated ai in some offerings or processes.  208  a few examples are energy storage  medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy  or supply chain management. ai applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. ai has been used to investigate patterns in largescale and smallscale evacuations using historical data from gps videos or social media. furthermore ai can provide realtime information on the evacuation conditions.  209   210   211  in agriculture ai has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments. agronomists use ai to conduct research and development. ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics  classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water. artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights. for example it is used for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. additionally it could be used for activities in space such as space exploration including the analysis of data from space missions realtime science decisions of spacecraft space debris avoidance and more autonomous operation. during the 2024 indian elections  us50 million was spent on authorized aigenerated content notably by creating deepfakes of allied including sometimes deceased politicians to better engage with voters and by translating speeches to various local languages.  212  ai has potential benefits and potential risks.  215  ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems demis hassabis of deepmind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else.  216  however as the use of ai has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.  217   218  inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.  219  machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy  surveillance and copyright . aipowered devices and services such as virtual assistants and iot products continuously collect personal information raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. the loss of privacy is further exacerbated by ais ability to process and combine vast amounts of data potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. sensitive user data collected may include online activity records geolocation data video or audio.  220  for example in order to build speech recognition algorithms amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them.  221  opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy .  222  ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation  deidentification and differential privacy .  223  since 2016 some privacy experts such as cynthia dwork  have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of what they know to the question of what theyre doing with it.  224  generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of  fair use . experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work.  225   226  website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a  robots.txt  file.  227  in 2023 leading authors including john grisham and jonathan franzen  sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai.  228   229  another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.  230  the commercial ai scene is dominated by big tech companies such as alphabet inc.  amazon  apple inc.  meta platforms  and microsoft .  231   232   233  some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers  allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.  234   235  in january 2024 the international energy agency iea released electricity 2024 analysis and forecast to 2026  forecasting electric power use.  236  this is the first iea report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. the report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026 with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole japanese nation.  237  prodigious power consumption by ai is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use and might delay closings of obsolete carbonemitting coal energy facilities. there is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the us making large technology firms e.g. microsoft meta google amazon into voracious consumers of electric power. projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. a chatgpt search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a google search. the large firms are in haste to find power sources  from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. the tech firms argue that  in the long view  ai will be eventually kinder to the environment but they need the energy now. ai makes the power grid more efficient and intelligent will assist in the growth of nuclear power and track overall carbon emissions according to technology firms.  238  a 2024 goldman sachs research paper ai data centers and the coming us power demand surge  found us power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation.... and forecasts that by 2030 us data centers will consume 8 of us power as opposed to 3 in 2022 presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.  239  data centers need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. the big tech companies counter that ai can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.  240  in 2024 the wall street journal reported that big ai companies have begun negotiations with the us nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. in march 2024 amazon purchased a pennsylvania nuclearpowered data center for us650 million.  241  nvidia ceo jensen huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.  242  in september 2024 microsoft announced an agreement with constellation energy to reopen the three mile island nuclear power plant to provide microsoft with 100 of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. reopening the plant which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its unit 2 reactor in 1979 will require constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the us nuclear regulatory commission . if approved this will be the first ever us recommissioning of a nuclear plant over 835 megawatts of power  enough for 800000 homes  of energy will be produced. the cost for reopening and upgrading is estimated at us1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 us inflation reduction act .  243  the us government and the state of michigan are investing almost us2 billion to reopen the palisades nuclear reactor on lake michigan. closed since 2022 the plant is planned to be reopened in october 2025. the three mile island facility will be renamed the crane clean energy center after chris crane a nuclear proponent and former ceo of exelon who was responsible for exelons spinoff of constellation.  244  after the last approval in september 2023 taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 mw in 2024 due to power supply shortages.  245  taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.  245  on the other hand singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power but in 2022 lifted this ban.  245  although most nuclear plants in japan have been shut down after the 2011 fukushima nuclear accident  according to an october 2024 bloomberg article in japanese cloud gaming services company ubitus in which nvidia has a stake is looking for land in japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative ai.  246  ubitus ceo wesley kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient cheap and stable power for ai.  246  on 1 november 2024 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rejected an application submitted by talen energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station susquehanna to amazons data center.  247  according to the commission chairman willie l. phillips  it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.  247  in 2025 a report prepared by the international energy agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of ai at 180 million tons. by 2035 these emissions could rise to 300500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. this is below 1.5 of the energy sector emissions. the emissions reduction potential of ai was estimated at 5 of the energy sector emissions but rebound effects for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars can reduce it.  248  youtube  facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching. the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation  conspiracy theories  and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the ai recommended more of it. users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.  249  this convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government.  250  the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society. after the u.s. election in 2016 major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.  251  in the early 2020s generative ai began to create images audio and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs recordings or human writing  252  while realistic aigenerated videos became feasible in the mid2020s.  253   254   255  it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda  256  one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda .  257  ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates on a large scale among other risks.  258  ai researchers at microsoft  openai  universities and other organisations have suggested using  personhood credentials  as a way to overcome online deception enabled by ai models.  259  machine learning applications can be biased  k  if they learn from biased data.  261  the developers may not be aware that the bias exists.  262  discriminatory behavior by some llms can be observed in their output.  263  bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.  264   261  if a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people as it can in medicine  finance  recruitment  housing or policing  then the algorithm may cause discrimination .  265  the field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. on 28 june 2015 google photos s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and a friend as gorillas because they were black. the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people  266  a problem called sample size disparity.  267  google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla. eight years later in 2023 google photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from apple facebook microsoft and amazon.  268  compas is a commercial program widely used by u.s. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist . in 2016 julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61 the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would reoffend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not reoffend.  269  in 2017 several researchers  l  showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of reoffense were different for whites and blacks in the data.  271  a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender. the feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender.  272  moritz hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesnt work.  273  criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations  some of these recommendations will likely be racist.  274  thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. it is descriptive rather than prescriptive.  m  bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among ai engineers about 4 are black and 20 are women.  267  there are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. these notions depend on ethical assumptions and are influenced by beliefs about society. one broad category is distributive fairness  which focuses on the outcomes often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. representational fairness tries to ensure that ai systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. the most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context notably the type of ai application and the stakeholders. the subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many ai ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases but it may conflict with antidiscrimination laws .  260  at its 2022 conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct 2022 the association for computing machinery  in seoul south korea presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of selflearning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.  dubious  discuss   276  many ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.  277  particularly with deep neural networks  in which there are many non linear relationships between inputs and outputs. but some popular explainability techniques exist.  278  it is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. for example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.  279  another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia. having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading.  280  people who have been harmed by an algorithms decision have a right to an explanation.  281  doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. early drafts of the european unions general data protection regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.  n  industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used.  282  darpa established the xai explainable artificial intelligence program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.  283  several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. shap enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.  284  lime can locally approximate a models outputs with a simpler interpretable model.  285  multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.  286  deconvolution  deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.  287  for generative pretrained transformers  anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with humanunderstandable concepts.  288  artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors  such as authoritarian governments  terrorists  criminals or rogue states . a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision.  o  widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction .  290  even when used in conventional warfare they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person .  290  in 2014 30 nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations  convention on certain conventional weapons  however the united states and others disagreed.  291  by 2015 over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.  292  ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance . machine learning  operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation. advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decisionmaking more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets . it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware .  293  all these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlierai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china.  294   295  there are many other ways in which ai is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen. for example machinelearning ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.  296  economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.  297  in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai.  298  a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in longterm unemployment  but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed .  299  risk estimates vary for example in the 2010s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated 47 of u.s. jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only 9 of u.s. jobs as high risk.  p   301  the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies.  297  in april 2023 it was reported that 70 of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.  302   303  unlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in 2015 that the worry that ai could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously.  304  jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.  305  in july 2025 ford ceo jim farley predicted that artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all whitecollar workers in the u.s.  306  from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum  about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative valuebased judgement.  307  it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. this could as physicist stephen hawking stated  spell the end of the human race .  308  this scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a humanlike selfawareness or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character.  q  these scifi scenarios are misleading in several ways. first ai does not require humanlike sentience to be an existential risk. modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of an automated paperclip factory that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips.  310  stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead.  311  in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side.  312  second yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. the essential parts of civilization are not physical. things like ideologies  law  government  money and the economy are built on language  they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive.  313  geoffrey hinton said in 2025 that modern ai is particularly good at persuasion and getting better all the time. he asks suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the us. do you have to go there and do it yourself no. you just have to be good at persuasion.  314  the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai.  315  personalities such as stephen hawking  bill gates  and elon musk   316  as well as ai pioneers such as yoshua bengio  stuart russell  demis hassabis  and sam altman  have expressed concerns about existential risk from ai. in may 2023 geoffrey hinton announced his resignation from google in order to be able to freely speak out about the risks of ai without considering how this impacts google.  317  he notably mentioned risks of an ai takeover   318  and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of ai.  319  in 2023 many leading ai experts endorsed the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.  320  some other researchers were more optimistic. ai pioneer jrgen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in 95 of all cases ai research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier.  321  while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors.  322   323  andrew ng also argued that its a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on aiand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.  324  yann lecun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction.  325  in the early 2010s experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.  326  however after 2016 the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.  327  friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. eliezer yudkowsky  who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk.  328  machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.  329  the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality  329  and was founded at an aaai symposium in 2005.  330  other approaches include wendell wallach s artificial moral agents  331  and stuart j. russell s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.  332  active organizations in the ai opensource community include hugging face   333  google   334  eleutherai and meta .  335  various ai models such as llama 2  mistral or stable diffusion  have been made openweight  336   337  meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available. openweight models can be freely finetuned  which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own usecase.  338  openweight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. since they can be finetuned any builtin security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism  and that once released on the internet they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. they recommend prerelease audits and costbenefit analyses.  339  artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design development and implementation of an ai system. an ai framework such as the care and act framework developed by the alan turing institute and based on the sum values outlines four main ethical dimensions defined as follows  340   341  other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference  the montreal declaration for responsible ai and the ieees ethics of autonomous systems initiative among others  342  however these principles are not without criticism especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.  343  promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers.  344  the uk ai safety institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called inspect for ai safety evaluations available under an mit opensource licence which is freely available on github and can be improved with thirdparty packages. it can be used to evaluate ai models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities.  345  the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.  346  the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.  347  according to ai index at stanford  the annual number of airelated laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.  348   349  between 2016 and 2020 more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai.  350  most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada  china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates u.s. and vietnam. others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia.  350  the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june 2020 stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.  350  henry kissinger  eric schmidt  and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate ai.  351  in 2023 openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.  352  in 2023 the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance the body comprises technology company executives government officials and academics.  353  on 1 august 2024 the eu artificial intelligence act entered into force establishing the first comprehensive euwide ai regulation.  354  in 2024 the council of europe created the first international legally binding treaty on ai called the  framework convention on artificial intelligence and human rights democracy and the rule of law . it was adopted by the european union the united states the united kingdom and other signatories.  355  in a 2022 ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country 78 of chinese citizens but only 35 of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks.  348  a 2023 reuters ipsos poll found that 61 of americans agree and 22 disagree that ai poses risks to humanity.  356  in a 2023 fox news poll 35 of americans thought it very important and an additional 41 thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus 13 responding not very important and 8 responding not at all important.  357   358  in november 2023 the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.  359  28 countries including the united states china and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international cooperation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.  360   361  in may 2024 at the ai seoul summit  16 global ai tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of ai.  362   363  the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. the study of logic led directly to alan turing s theory of computation  which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.  365   366  this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics  information theory and neurobiology  led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.  r  they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai  368  such as mcculloch and pitts design for artificial neurons in 1943  117  and turings influential 1950 paper  computing machinery and intelligence  which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible.  369   366  the field of ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in 1956.  s   6  the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the 1960s.  t  they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing  u  computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english.  v   7  artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and u.s. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.  366  researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.  373  in 1965 herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do.  374  in 1967 marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation ... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved.  375  they had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem.  w  in 1974 both the u.s. and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill  377  and ongoing pressure from the u.s. congress to fund more productive projects .  378  minsky and papert s book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving realworld tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether.  379  the  ai winter  a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult followed.  9  in the early 1980s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems   380  a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. by 1985 the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars. at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the u.s. and british governments to restore funding for academic research .  8  however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting winter began.  10  up to this point most of ais funding had gone to projects that used highlevel symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts. in the 1980s some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception  robotics  learning and pattern recognition   381  and began to look into subsymbolic approaches.  382  rodney brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.  x  judea pearl  lotfi zadeh  and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.  87   387  but the most important development was the revival of  connectionism  including neural network research by geoffrey hinton and others.  388  in 1990 yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks.  389  ai gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. this  narrow  and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics  economics and mathematics .  390  by 2000 solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the 1990s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence a tendency known as the ai effect .  391  however several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines. beginning around 2002 they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several wellfunded institutions by the 2010s.  68  deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.  11  for many specific tasks other methods were abandoned.  y  deep learnings success was based on both hardware improvements  faster computers   393  graphics processing units  cloud computing  394   and access to large amounts of data  395  including curated datasets  394  such as imagenet . deep learnings success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai.  z  the amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by 50 in the years 20152019.  350  in 2016 issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers refocussed their careers on these issues. the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.  327  in the late 2010s and early 2020s agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. in 2015 alphago  developed by deepmind  beat the world champion go player . the program taught only the games rules and developed a strategy by itself. gpt3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by openai and is capable of generating highquality humanlike text.  396  chatgpt  launched on 30 november 2022 became the fastestgrowing consumer software application in history gaining over 100 million users in two months.  397  it marked what is widely regarded as ais breakout year bringing it into the public consciousness.  398  these programs and others inspired an aggressive ai boom  where large companies began investing billions of dollars in ai research. according to ai impacts about us50 billion annually was invested in ai around 2022 in the u.s. alone and about 20 of the new u.s. computer science phd graduates have specialized in ai.  399  about 800000 airelated u.s. job openings existed in 2022.  400  according to pitchbook research 22 of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be ai companies.  401  philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.  402  another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious and the associated ethical implications.  403  many other topics in philosophy are relevant to ai such as epistemology and free will .  404  rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of ai .  403  alan turing wrote in 1950 i propose to consider the question can machines think  405  he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour.  405  he devised the turing test  which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.  369  since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind. turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.  406  russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure.  1  however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans.  aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.    408  ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence.  409  mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.  410  another ai founder marvin minsky  similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems.  411  the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.  1  these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible. another definition has been adopted by google  412  a major practitioner in the field of ai. this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. as a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the ai discourse itself  413  including discussing the many ai narratives and myths to be found within societal political and academic discourses.  414  similarly in practice some authors have suggested that the term ai is often used too broadly and vaguely. this raises the question of where the line should be drawn between ai and classical algorithms  415  with many companies during the early 2020s ai boom using the term as a marketing buzzword  often even if they did not actually use ai in a material way.  416  there has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text .  417  no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history.  aa  the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks. this approach is mostly subsymbolic  soft and narrow . critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers. symbolic ai or  gofai   419  simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics. they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests. in the 1960s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis  a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.  420  however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult.  421  philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.  422  although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him.  ab   16  the issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias . critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence  424   425  in part because subsymbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai  it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision. the emerging field of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic  optimization  or neural networks . scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. this issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s  426  but eventually was seen as irrelevant. modern ai has elements of both. finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.  15  soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms  fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation. soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful ai programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields longterm goals.  427   428  general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. the subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. there is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind  consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior. mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. russell and norvig add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.  429  however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction . david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness.  430  the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior. the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion. while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain. for example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like .  431  computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem . this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam .  432  philosopher john searle characterized this position as  strong ai  the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.  ac  searle challenges this claim with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.  436  it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree.  437  but if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals.  438   439  sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or selfawareness  may provide another moral basis for ai rights.  438  robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.  440  in 2017 the european union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable ai systems. similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.  441  critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights  and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own.  442   443  progress in ai increased interest in the topic. proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny. they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming  which could lead to largescale suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited.  439   438  a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.  428  if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what i. j. good called an  intelligence explosion  and vernor vinge called a  singularity .  444  however technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an sshaped curve  slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.  445  robot designer hans moravec  cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. this idea called transhumanism has roots in the writings of aldous huxley and robert ettinger .  446  edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler s  darwin among the machines  as far back as 1863 and expanded upon by george dyson in his 1998 book darwin among the machines the evolution of global intelligence .  447  thoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity  448  and have been a persistent theme in science fiction .  449  a common trope in these works began with mary shelley s frankenstein  where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. this includes such works as arthur c. clarkes and stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey both 1968 with hal 9000  the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator 1984 and the matrix 1999. in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still 1951 and bishop from aliens 1986 are less prominent in popular culture.  450  isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many stories most notably with the  multivac  superintelligent computer. asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics  451  while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity.  452  several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel  and thus to suffer. this appears in karel apek s r.u.r.  the films a.i. artificial intelligence and ex machina  as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep  by philip k. dick . dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.  453  the two most widely used textbooks in 2023 see the open syllabus ,13683
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,artificial intelligence  simple english wikipedia the free encyclopedia,artificial intelligence  ai or a.i.  is a computer program or a machine that is able to learn and mimic human cognition .  1   2  sometimes ai is used to talk about neural networks or deep learning .  3  artificial intelligence is a systems ability to understand external data  to learn from that data and to use what it has learned to achieve specific goals or tasks through adaptation .  4  artificial intelligence is widely applied in speech recognition  image recognition  robotics  autonomous systems  natural language processing  machine translation  predictive analytics  medical diagnostics  fraud detection  and the control of physical processes . john mccarthy came up with the name artificial intelligence in 1956. intelligence allows an organism to act in a meaningful way in its environment. it includes the ability to get sensory inputs and to react to these. the european union made a law 2024s second quarter about artificial intelligence . it is the worlds first law that regulates ai.  5  connecticut and colorado tried to pass laws in 2024 regarding use of ai.  6  ai research started with a conference at dartmouth college in 1956. it was a monthlong brainstorming session many people who like ai came to. at the conference they wrote programs which were able to beat humans at checkers or solving word problems. the department of defense started giving a lot of money to ai research and labs were created all over the world. in a paper on ai mathematician james lighthill wrote  no aspect of the discipline has so far seen discoveries generated the huge influence that was previously anticipated in no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised. 1 . the governments of the us and uk decided to spend money on other projects which caused little new research to be done. this was known as an ai winter.  7  in the 90s and early 2000s ai became important again in data mining and medical diagnosis. this was possible because of faster computers and focusing on solving more specific problems. in 1997 the chess computer deep blue became the first computer program to beat chess world champion garry kasparov . in 2011 ibm watson beat the top two jeopardy players brad rutter and ken jennings . in 2016 googles alphago beat top go player lee sedol 4 out of 5 times. the idea is perhaps much older. julien offray de la mettrie 17091751 was a materialist thinker of the enlightenment . in his work of 1748 lhomme machine he had the idea that both matter and life organized themselves.  8  he is seen as one of the precursors of darwins theory of evolution .  9  today one field of artificial intelligence called strong artificial intelligence wants to build a machine that can think like a person.  10  however weak artificial intelligence is about building a system that can support a human. one of the key problems is to make systems that can model wiktuncertainity . most of the time this is done with probability theory and statistics . artificial intelligence is used in many different areas today. those subjects are part of game artificial intelligence . some software has become wellknown such as chatgpt a chatbot and virtual assistant . there are different domains of artificial intelligence. researchers kaplan and haenlein say there are three types of ai system analytical humaninspired and humanized artificial intelligence.  4  in 2025 a municipality in norway made a report in regard to permanently closing down schools the report used ghost source or fictitious sources those sources were claimed to be the works of two named professors the municipality admitted that the report was made partly by a.i. the process of closing down schools has stopped as of march.  12  an official that was involved resigned or left her job one month later.  13  see hallucination artificial intelligence  a.i. chips are a kind of computer chip  according to media.  14   15  researchers didnt know how difficult several issues were. they still couldnt offer computers things like emotions or common sense . faster computers deep learning and more data have made ai popular throughout the world.  16  an great intelligent machine is flexible and perceives what is around it. it would use what it learns to make its chance of success at some goal better.  17  ai has been successful with decoding human speech   1  playing games like chess and go  selfdriving cars  and understanding complex data.  18  someday ai researchers hope to create computer programs that can learn solve problems and think logically.  19   20  so far most ai programs only do what computers can do well like searching databases or doing calculations. ai is not able to sense and understand what is happening around itself because of problems with what computers can do. ai involves many different fields like computer science  mathematics  linguistics  psychology  neuroscience  and philosophy . researchers hope to make a general artificial intelligence which can solve many problems instead of focusing on just one. researchers are also trying to make creative and emotional ai which could create art. alan turing wrote in 1950 i propose to consider the question can machines think  21  he said the question should be changed from if a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behavior.  21  alan turing also created the turing test . this is a very general test. if a human cannot tell if at the other end of the line there is a machine or a human answering questions the machine is intelligent. the authors of artificial intelligence a modern approach agree with turing that ai must be defined by acting and not thinking.  22  but they dont think the test compares machines to people .  aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.    23  ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence.  24   25  computers can do some things like learning and problem solving  but not in the same way as people do.  1  interestingly advancements in ai have expanded its applications including the use of large language models llms to humanize aigenerated text. this reflects a growing interest in bridging the gap between machine outputs and humanlike expression.  26  ai and machine learning technology is used in applications including search engines  recommendation systems  virtual assistants  autonomous vehicles  automatic language translation  facial recognition  image labeling  advertising and driving internet traffic . one interesting use of ai is in helping people with their personal relationships. for example chatgpt is a powerful ai tool that can create humanlike text and assist in many communication tasks.  25  optical character recognition is no longer thought of as an example of artificial intelligence since its now commonly used.,1153
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_marketing,digital marketing  wikipedia,digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the internet and online based digital technologies such as desktop computers  mobile phones  and other digital media and platforms to promote products and services.  2   3  it has significantly transformed the way brands and businesses utilize technology for marketing since the 1990s and 2000s. as digital platforms became increasingly incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life  4  and as people increasingly used digital devices instead of visiting physical shops  5   6  digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent employing combinations of methods. some of these methods include search engine optimization seo search engine marketing sem content marketing  influencer marketing  content automation campaign marketing data driven marketing ecommerce marketing social media marketing  social media optimization  email direct marketing  display advertising  ebooks  and optical disks and games. digital marketing extends to noninternet channels that provide digital media such as television  mobile phones  sms and mms  callbacks and onhold mobile ringtones.  7  the extension to noninternet channels differentiates digital marketing from online marketing .  8  digital marketing effectively began in 1990 when the archie search engine was created as an index for ftp sites. in the 1980s the storage capacity of computers was already large enough to store huge volumes of customer information. companies started choosing online techniques such as database marketing  rather than limited list brokers .  9  databases allowed companies to track customers information more effectively transforming the relationship between buyer and seller. in the 1990s the term digital marketing was coined.  citation needed  the first clickable banner ad  the you will campaign by att  went live in 1994 and over the first four months 44 of all people who saw it clicked on the ad.  10   11  early digital marketing efforts focused on simple html websites and the burgeoning practice of email marketing which allowed for direct communication with consumers.  12  in the 2000s with increasing numbers of internet users and the birth of the iphone  customers began searching for products and making decisions about their needs online first instead of consulting a salesperson  which created a new problem for the marketing department of a company.  13  in addition a survey in 2000 in the united kingdom found that most retailers still needed to register their own domain address.  14  these problems encouraged marketers to find new ways to integrate digital technology into market development. at the same time payperclick ppc advertising introduced by google adwords in 2000 allowed businesses to target specific keywords making digital marketing more measurable and costeffective.  15  the mid2000s saw the emergence of social media platforms like facebook 2004 youtube 2005 and twitter 2006. these platforms revolutionized digital marketing by facilitating direct and interactive engagement with consumers. in 2007 marketing automation was developed as a response to the everevolving marketing climate. marketing automation is the process by which software is used to automate conventional marketing processes.  16  marketing automation helps companies segment customers launch multichannel marketing campaigns and provide personalized information for customers.  16  based on their specific activities. in this way users activity or lack thereof triggers a personal message that is customized to the user in their preferred platform. however despite the benefits of marketing automation many companies are struggling to adapt it to their everyday uses correctly.  17   page needed  digital marketing became more sophisticated in the 2000s and the 2010s when  18   19  the proliferation of devices capable of accessing digital media led to sudden growth.  20  statistics produced in 2012 and 2013 showed that digital marketing was still growing.  21   22  with the development of social media in the 2000s such as linkedin  facebook  youtube  and twitter  consumers became highly dependent on digital electronics in their daily lives. therefore they expected a seamless user experience across different channels for searching product information. the change in customer behavior improved the diversification of marketing technology.  23  digital media growth was estimated at 4.5 trillion online ads served annually with digital media spending at 48 growth in 2010.  24  an increasing portion of advertising stems from businesses employing online behavioural advertising oba to tailor advertising for internet users but oba raises concerns about consumer privacy and data protection .  20  nonlinear marketing a type of interactive marketing is a longterm marketing approach that builds on businesses collecting information about an internet users online activities and trying to be visible in multiple areas.  25  unlike traditional marketing techniques which involve direct oneway messaging to consumers via print television  and radio advertising nonlinear digital marketing strategies are centered on reaching prospective customers across multiple online channels.  citation needed  combined with higher consumer knowledge and the demand for more sophisticated consumer offerings this change has forced many businesses to rethink their outreach strategy and adopt or incorporate omnichannel nonlinear marketing techniques to maintain sufficient brand exposure engagement and reach.  citation needed  nonlinear marketing strategies involve efforts to adapt the advertising to different platforms  26  and to tailor the advertising to different individual buyers rather than a large coherent audience.  27  some studies indicate that consumer responses to traditional marketing approaches are becoming less predictable for businesses.  28  according to a 2018 study nearly 90 of online consumers in the united states researched products and brands online before visiting the store or making a purchase.  29  the global web index estimated that in 2018 a little more than 50 of consumers researched products on social media.  30  businesses often rely on individuals portraying their products in a positive light on social media and may adapt their marketing strategy to target people with large social media followings in order to generate such comments.  31  in this manner businesses can use consumers to advertise their products or services decreasing the cost for the company.  32  one of the key objectives of modern digital marketing is to raise brand awareness  the extent to which customers and the public are familiar with and recognize a particular brand. enhancing brand awareness is important in digital marketing and marketing in general because of its impact on brand perception and consumer decisionmaking. according to the 2015 essay impact of brand on consumer behavior brand awareness as one of the fundamental dimensions of brand equity  is often considered to be a prerequisite of consumers buying decision as it represents the main factor for including a brand in the consideration set . brand awareness can also influence consumers perceived risk assessment and their confidence in the purchase decision due to familiarity with the brand and its characteristics.  33  recent trends show that businesses and digital marketers are prioritizing brand awareness focusing more on their digital marketing efforts on cultivating brand recognition and recall than in previous years. this is evidenced by a 2019 content marketing institute study which found that 81 of digital marketers have worked on enhancing brand recognition over the past year.  34  another content marketing institute survey revealed that 89 of b2b marketers now believe improving brand awareness to be more important than efforts directed at increasing sales.  35  increasing brand awareness is a focus of digital marketing strategy for a number of reasons digital marketing strategies may include the use of one or more online channels and techniques omnichannel to increase brand awareness among consumers. building brand awareness may

marketing strategies in order to adapt to this major change in traditional marketing. as digital marketing is dependent on technology which is everevolving and fastchanging the same features should be expected from digital marketing developments and strategies. this section attempts to list the notable current highlights in use at the time of writing.  when  to summarize pull digital marketing is characterized by consumers actively seeking marketing content while push digital marketing occurs when marketers send messages without that content being actively sought by the recipients. an important consideration today while deciding on a strategy is that the digital tools have democratized the promotional landscape. six principles for building online brand content  56  tourism marketing advanced tourism responsible and sustainable tourism social media and online tourism marketing and geographic information systems. as a broader research field matures and attracts more diverse and indepth academic research.  57  the new digital era has enabled brands to selectively target their customers that may potentially be interested in their brand or based on previous browsing interests. businesses can use social media to select the age range location gender and interests of whom they would like their targeted post to be seen. furthermore based on a customers recent search history they can be followed on the internet so they see advertisements from similar brands products and services  58  that allows businesses to target the specific customers that they know and feel will most benefit from their product or service something that had limited capabilities up until the digital era. digital marketing activity is still growing across the world according to the headline global marketing index. a study published in september 2018 found that global outlays on digital marketing tactics are approaching 100 billion.  59  digital media continues to rapidly grow. while the marketing budgets are expanding traditional media is declining.  60  digital media helps brands reach consumers to engage with their product or service in a personalized way. five areas which are outlined as current industry practices that are often ineffective are prioritizing clicks balancing search and display understanding mobiles targeting viewability brand safety and invalid traffic and crossplatform measurement.  61  why these practices are ineffective and some ways around making these aspects effective are discussed surrounding the following points. prioritizing clicks refers to display click ads although advantageous by being simple fast and inexpensive rates for display ads in 2016 is only 0.10 percent in the united states. this means one in a thousand click ads is relevant therefore having little effect. this displays that marketing companies should not just use click ads to evaluate the effectiveness of display advertisements.  61  balancing search and display for digital display ads is important. marketers tend to look at the last search and attribute all of the effectiveness of this. this in turn disregards other marketing efforts which establish brand value within the consumers mind. comscore determined through drawing on data online produced by over one hundred multichannel retailers that digital display marketing poses strengths when compared with or positioned alongside paid search.  61  this is why it is advised that when someone clicks on a display ad the company opens a landing page not its home page. a landing page typically has something to draw the customer in to search beyond this page. commonly marketers see increased sales among people exposed to a search ad. but the fact of how many people you can reach with a display campaign compared to a search campaign should be considered. multichannel retailers have an increased reach if the display is considered in synergy with search campaigns. overall both search and display aspects are valued as display campaigns build awareness for the brand so that more people are likely to click on these digital ads when running a search campaign.  61  understanding mobile devices is a significant aspect of digital marketing because smartphones and tablets are now responsible for 64 of the time us consumers are online.  61  apps provide a big opportunity as well as challenge for the marketers because firstly the app needs to be downloaded and secondly the person needs to actually use it. this may be difficult as half the time spent on smartphone apps occurs on the individuals single most used app and almost 85 of their time on the top four rated apps.  61  mobile advertising can assist in achieving a variety of commercial objectives and it is effective due to taking over the entire screen and voice or status is likely to be considered highly. however the message must not be seen or thought of as intrusive.  61  disadvantages of digital media used on mobile devices also include limited creative capabilities and reach. although there are many positive aspects including the users entitlement to select product information digital media creating a flexible message platform and there is potential for direct selling.  62  the number of marketing channels continues to expand as measurement practices are growing in complexity. a crossplatform view must be used to unify audience measurement and media planning. market researchers need to understand how the omnichannel affects consumers behavior although when advertisements are on a consumers device this does not get measured. significant aspects to crossplatform measurement involve deduplication and understanding that you have reached an incremental level with another platform rather than delivering more impressions against people that have previously been reached.  61  an example is espn and comscore partnered on project blueprint discovering the sports broadcaster achieved a 21 increase in unduplicated daily reach thanks to digital advertising.  61  television and radio industries are the electronic media which competes with digital and other technological advertising. yet television advertising is not directly competing with online digital advertising due to being able to cross platform with digital technology. radio also gains power through cross platforms in online streaming content. television and radio continue to persuade and affect the audience across multiple platforms.  63  targeting viewability brand safety and invalid traffic all are aspects used by marketers to help advocate digital advertising. cookies are a form of digital advertising which are tracking tools within desktop devices causing difficulty with shortcomings including deletion by web browsers the inability to sort between multiple users of a device inaccurate estimates for unique visitors overstating reach understanding frequency problems with ad servers which cannot distinguish between when cookies have been deleted and when consumers have not previously been exposed to an ad. due to the inaccuracies influenced by cookies demographics in the target market are low and vary.  61  another element which is affected by digital marketing is viewability or whether the ad was actually seen by the consumer. many ads are not seen by a consumer and may never reach the right demographic segment. brand safety is another issue of whether or not the ad was produced in the context of being unethical or having offensive content. recognizing fraud when an ad is exposed is another challenge marketers face. this relates to invalid traffic as premium sites are more effective at detecting fraudulent traffic although nonpremium sites are more so the problem.  61  digital marketing channels are systems based on the internet that can create accelerate and transmit product value from producer to a consumer terminal through digital networks.  64   65  digital marketing is facilitated by multiple digital marketing channels as an advertiser ones core objective is to find channels which result in maximum twoway communication and a better overall roi for the brand. there are multiple digital marketing channels available namely  66  it is important for a firm to reach out to consumers and create a twoway communication model as digital marketing allows consumers to give back feedback to the firm on a communitybased site or straight directly to the firm via email.  79  firms should seek this longterm communication relationship by using multiple forms of channels and using promotional strategies related to their target consumer as well as wordofmouth marketing.  79  digital marketing used to rely primarily on selfregulation included in the icc code  83  which included rules that apply to marketing communications using digital interactive media. however selfregulation has proved largely ineffective  84   85  leading to the consolidation of market power in a few firms including google  which has been determined to hold monopolies in search marketing and digital advertising.  86   87  while selfregulation codes still exist government regulation is increasing in multiple jurisdictions including californias legislation on targeting advertising online.  88  in europe digital marketing is regulated through multiple codes of which the most important is the digital services act   89  which entered into force on 17 february 2024. other regulations focus on user privacy and data management such as the general data protection regulation gdpr.  90  digital marketing planning is a term used in marketing management. it describes the first stage of forming a digital marketing strategy for the wider digital marketing system . the difference between digital and traditional marketing planning is that it uses digitally based communication tools and technology such as social web mobile scannable surface.  91   92  nevertheless both are aligned with the vision the mission of the company and the overarching business strategy.  93  dr. dave chaffey an author on marketing topics has suggested that successful digital marketing strategies have do digital marketing planning dmp which is a threestage approach opportunity strategy and action. this generic strategic approach often has phases of situation review goal setting strategy formulation resource allocation and monitoring.  93  to create an effective dmp a business first needs to review the marketplace and set smart specific measurable actionable relevant and timebound objectives.  94  they can set smart objectives by reviewing the current benchmarks and key performance indicators kpis of the company and competitors. it is pertinent that the analytics used for the kpis be customized to the type objectives mission and vision of the company.  95   96  companies can scan for marketing and sales opportunities by reviewing their own outreach as well as influencer outreach. this means they have competitive advantage because they are able to analyse their comarketers influence and brand associations.  97  to seize the opportunity the firm should summarize its current customers personas and purchase journey from this they are able to deduce their digital marketing capability.  98  a planned digital strategy is where a company expresses clearly what they are offering customers online e.g. brand positioning. the marketing mix is a framework which can be used to facilitate this.  99   100  the third and final stage requires the firm to set a budget and management systems. these must be measurable touchpoints such as the audience reached across all digital platforms. furthermore marketers must ensure the budget and management systems are integrating the paid owned and earned media of the company.  101  the action and final stage of planning also requires the company to set in place measurable content creation e.g. oral visual or written online media.  102  one way marketers can reach out to consumers and understand their thought process is through what is called an empathy map. an empathy map is a fourstep process. the first step is through asking questions that the consumer would be thinking in their demographic. the second step is to describe the feelings that the consumer may be having. the third step is to think about what the consumer would say in their situation. the final step is to imagine what the consumer will try to do based on the other three steps. this map is so marketing teams can put themselves in their target demographics shoes.  103  web analytics are also a very important way to understand consumers. they show the habits that people have online for each website.  104  one particular form of these analytics is predictive analytics which helps marketers figure out what route consumers are on. this uses the information gathered from other analytics and then creates different predictions of what people will do so that companies can strategize on what to do next according to the peoples trends.  105  the sharing economy refers to an economic pattern that aims to obtain a resource that is not fully used.  108  nowadays the sharing economy has had an unimagined effect on many traditional elements including labor industry and distribution system.  108  this effect is not negligible that some industries are obviously under threat.  108   109  the sharing economy is influencing the traditional marketing channels by changing the nature of some specific concept including ownership assets and recruitment.  109  digital marketing channels and traditional marketing channels are similar in function that the value of the product or service is passed from the original producer to the end user by a kind of supply chain.  110  digital marketing channels however consist of internet systems that create promote and deliver products or services from producer to consumer through digital networks.  111  increasing changes to marketing channels has been a significant contributor to the expansion and growth of the sharing economy.  111  such changes to marketing channels has prompted unprecedented and historic growth.  111  in addition to this typical approach the builtin control efficiency and low cost of digital marketing channels is an essential features in the application of sharing economy.  110  digital marketing channels within the sharing economy are typically divided into three domains including email social media and search engine marketing or sem.  111  other emerging digital marketing channels particularly branded mobile apps have excelled in the sharing economy.  111  branded mobile apps are created specifically to initiate engagement between customers and the company. this engagement is typically facilitated through entertainment information or market transaction.  111 ,3724
